{'This key research resource is an important survival, being a manuscript account book detailing transactions - debits and credits - relating to the lead-ore company at Leadhills, operated by Sir John Hope of Craighall. Many important people are mentioned in this book, including Alexander Hope of London, Archibald Hope of Craighall, the Earl of Wigtown, the Duke of Hamilton, the Lord of Inglestone, Charles Erskine of Alba, Alexander Tait, Lady Marie Keith, the Earl of Crawford, Lord Mordington, Lord Cardcross, and Alexander Ross. The amounts involved are huge, with the account of revenues in hand running to over £70,000 towards the end of the period. The manuscript volume itself is composed of a short alphabetic table of names, then from folio 1, accounts dating from 1 August 1662, Edinburgh, to 7 September 1671, Edinburgh, at folio 221. Towards the rear of the volume are another set of accounts and revenues and interests on 87 folios.'}

{"The Scottish judge, Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall, was born around 1605 and was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall, first baronet. He studied for the legal profession, became an advocate, and was knighted in 1632. In 1640 he was placed on the Committee of Estates appointed to provide for the defence of the country against King Charles I (the Committee of Estates had been appointed to govern Scotland when Parliament was not in session). In 1651, his brother Sir Alexander Hope was examined by the Committee of Estates for advising the King to surrender Scotland and Ireland to Cromwell, during which he quoted Sir John, Lord Craighall, as having stated that the King should 'treat with Cromwell for one-half of his coat before he lost the whole'. In 1652, Sir John was appointed as one of three Scottish judges who, together with five English judges, comprised Cromwell's committee responsible for the administration of justice. Another brother, Sir James Hope (1614-1661), was a representative for Scotland in the English Parliament in 1653. Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall, died in Edinburgh on 28 April 1654. It had been Sir John Hope and Sir James Hope who in the 1660s had owned the lead-ore company at Leadhills in the Lowther Hills - an area along with Wanlockhead which yielded other ores too. Indeed gold was discovered in the area during the reign of James IV, when gold-mining had provided employment for 300 persons. Although gold-mining declined, the export of lead-ore from Leadhills was very important in the early modern Scottish economy, and the Hope family had built on their control of this industry to acquire property and land. The lead mines were profitable enough to justify building or improving roads the full 50 miles to Leith from which the ore could be exported to the Low Countries for smelting."}

{"The manuscript materialLe Thresor des Divines et Celestes Consolations'(London, 1643) was bound by 'Lord Herbert's Binder'. It contains 21 chapters on the nature and benefits of Afflictions. A rough translation of the introduction gives the flavour: 'Friendly Reader, this book, to which I have given light, shows how tribulations tear us away from sin, which is the source and origin of all pain; it brings us to virtue, to good, and to God, who is the means, the Principle, indeed who is in Himself all the Sovereign good. And afterwards it produces the means to keep always on the right path of virtue, eases our path towards Heaven, and forces us through a secret violence and voluntary constraints, despising that which is of the world (holding its voluptuousness, its delights and vanities against one's will and in disgust) and to breathe towards Heaven, with tears in the eyes, sighs on the lips and sobs in the heart.' The volume is dedicated to Edward Montagu, 2nd. Earl of Manchester (1602-1671), the Presbyterian and a Parliamentary leader. Manchester had succeeded his father as 2nd. Earl of Manchester in November 1642. In August 1643 he was appointed Sergeant-Major-General of the Associated Counties of East Anglia."}

{"The name David de Hasteville, in London, first appears in theCalendar of State Papers, Domestic series, of the reign of Charles I. 1640-41., p.377, in the 'Petition of David de Hasteville, formerly called Father Archange de Hasteville, Abbé du Val de Sainte Croix and General of the Order of St. Romuald to [Sec. Windebank]'. De Hasteville had recently become a Protestant and was seeking 'some sort of entertainment or pension'. He had also petitioned the House of Commons in 1648, describing himself as a Protestant who had recently left his native France and 'a plentiful estate'. Apparently in 1643 he had been appointed general of artillery under Sir William Waller, and had raised three hundred and fourteen men at his own cost, not receiving any government cash, and was then in danger of arrest for money owed for the billetting of his soldiers."}

{"The letter is said to be a forgery of a letter from Robert Burns to Edinburgh engraver James Johnson by forger Alexander Howland 'Antique' Smith. Smith was responsible for forgeries of letters not only by Robert Burns but by Sir Walter Scott and Mary Stuart and many prominent historical figures. He had earned the nickname 'Antique' Smith from his interest in old documents and ephemera. Smith appeared in the High Court of Justiciary, Edinburgh, on 26 June 1893 charged with selling and pawning spurious manuscripts as genuine, obtaining money by pretending that certain documents were genuine and not what they purported to be, and by offering false stories as to the origin of documents and manuscripts when knowing them to be false. The circulation of forgeries came to light the previous November in an article in theEdinburgh Evening Dispatch. Facsimiles of the forgers notes had been included in the article and a reader recognised the handwriting as that of a copying clerk working in various Edinburgh law offices - the clerk was 'Antique' Smith. Smith's explanation was that while in employment with the firm of Thomas Henry Ferrier WS as chief clerk he had been asked to get rid of a huge quantity of old documents that had accumulated in the cellars of the law office. On examining these he had found that many of the documents were of value and so he had begun selling them to booksellers, auction rooms and pawnbrokers. When the original stock ran out he had then provided fakes to replace them, and he claimed that he was able to supply any type of document required. Smith - the one and only mass-producer of literary forgeries in Scottish history - was found guilty on all charges but leniency was recommended. He was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment."}

{"William Hunter was born on 1 June 1861 in Ballantrae on the Ayrshire coast. He was educated at Ayr Academy, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University, graduating in 1883 with M.B., C.M. (1st Class) 1883, and M.D. (Gold Medal) 1886. He served as a house physician at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, and as a Physican to the Western Dispensary, Edinburgh. He had also studied overseas at Leipzig in 1884 with a grant from the BMA, and during the period 1887-1890 he visited Vienna and Strasbourg. Also during 1887-1890 he worked full time on laboratory research at Cambridge, devoting himself to pernicious anaemia. From 1895, Hunter was affiliated with the Charing Cross Hospital and the London Fever Hospital. Earlier, in 1894, he married Beatrice Fielden, daughter of Joshua Fielden MP. He was the first person to note that the alimentary and the nervous system were often affected in pernicious anaemia, and he regarded the haemolytic element as being most important and made numerous observations on the excessive pigmentation and iron deposition in the liver. Hunter, along with Julius Otto Ludwig Moeller, is associated with 'Hunter's glossitis' caused by B12 or folic acid deficiency ('Moeller-Hunter glossitis'), and he is also associated with the 'Serbian barrel' used for disinfection and the eradication of lice during the First World War in Serbia. During the First World War, Hunter served in Serbia with the British Military Sanitary Mission where he developed de-lousing techniques to control typhus. He was appointed as a Grand Officer of the Serbian Order of St. Sava in June 1915. In December 1915 he was mentioned in Dispatches and was awarded the Companion Order of the Bath (CB). He was President of the Advisory Committee, Prevention of Disease, in the Eastern Mediterranean and Mesopotamia (Gallipoli, Egypt, Salonika, Malta and Palestine), and he served with the Eastern Command, 1917-1919, as Consulting Physician. He held the rank of Colonel. Hunter's published work includesOral sepsis as a cause of 'Septic gastritis', 'Toxic neuritis' and other septic conditions(1901),Pernicious anaemia: its pathology, septic origin, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Based upon original investigations(1901),A research into epidemic and epizootic plague(1904),Severest anaemias.

The roll is contained in black leather covered tube with gilt blocked title and date. The blocked title states: 'Call / to the Rev. William Dobbie / by Castlehill United Free Church / Forres / August 6th 1907"}
bioghist
{"This collection is composed simply of an invitation - dated 6 August 1907 - from the elders, managers and members of the congregation to the Rev. William Dobbie to take up the post of Pastor at Castle Hill United Free Church in Forres, Moray, Scotland. William Dobbie was born on 21 May 1881 in Ayr. He attended Ayr Academy and studied at Glasgow University. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Ayr in May 1906, and assisted at Glasgow Camphill until 1907 when he was ordained and inducted at Castle Hill U. F. Church in Forres, 20 September 1907. Dobbie married Jean Fulton Hamilton on 25 April 1911. In 1914 he translated to Glasgow Govanhill and then did war service with the YMCA in France in 1916. In 1921 he translated to Lanark Cairns. The Rev. William Dobbie died on 30 April 1946. For the origins of Castlehill U. F. Church, we have to look at events of 1733 when the First (or original) Secession saw members leave the Church of Scotland as a protest against the system of Patronage, by which a minister was appointed to a congregation on presentation by a landowner. A congregation was founded in 1768, when a group in Forres joined the Secession Movement. The first church was built at the north end of Batchen Street, Forres. It had various names over time: United Secession; United Presbyterian; and, United Free. The foundation stone of the Castlehill Church was laid on September 22, 1870, and it was opened and dedicated on November 26, 1871, with building costs of £3,000. In 1900, the United Presbyterian and the Free Churches united to form the United Free Church of Scotland. This meant that there were two U.F. Churches in Forres, and each had to take a distinctive name. It was at that point that it was named Castlehill, from the site on which it stood, and the other became the High Church. In 1902 the Town Council presented the freedom of the burgh to Lord Strathcona in Castlehill Church. In 1903 James MacDougall Black became the minister and remained until 1907. Dr Black was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for the year 1938-1939. Two outbreaks of dry-rot, in 1902 and in 1946, meant that extensive and expensive work was necessary, and this was paid for by the congregation and by generous donations from Lord and Lady Strathcona and Andrew Carnegie. When the Rev. David Leslie Scott, Minister of Forres Castlehill Church, retired on 30 June 1972 the church was closed and the charge united with Forres High Church under the name of Forres St Leonard's. The former Castlehill Church was sold to the Forres Parish Church of St. Laurence and became its church halls. After a protracted period of refurbishment, it was eventually opened and dedicated on September 5, 1976. Dry-rot however can never be eradicated completely and some thirty years after the last repair the rot had reached such as state that it became beyond the economic means of the congregation of the Parish Church of St. Laurence. The building was finally sold on 30 June 2006, which was 34-years after the building was closed as a church."}

{'Charles Hedges was born in either 1649 or 1650. he was educated at Magdalen, Oxford, where he took a B.A. in 1670, an M.A. in 1673, and a D.C.L in 1675. In his last year of study he was admitted to the Society of Advocates, and by 1686 he was Chancellor and Vicar-General of the Diocese of Rochester. In 1689 he was created Master of the Faculties and Judge of the Admiralty Court. Hedges was also knighted on 4 June 1689. From 1698 he contested various constituencies for a seat in Parliament including Orford in Suffolk, Dover, Calne and Malmesbury, West Looe, and East Looe. In 1700 he became a Secretary of State and Privy Councillor with the help of the Earl of Rochester (1641-1711). For some time Sir Charles Hedges resided at Richmond Green, but in 1700 he bought an estate in Compton Bassett, near Calne in Wiltshire. Hedges died on 10 June 1714. The background to the collection item, from Hedges as Secretary of State, to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, is the Aliens Act of 1705 which stated that, from Christmas Day 1705 until the Scottish Parliament passed an Act settling the Scottish Crown upon the successor to the English Crown, every Scot should be considered an alien. At the time that the letter was written (November 1706) the Viceroy (Lord Lieutenant) of Ireland was James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde KG, KT (1665–1745), Irish statesman and soldier. The Duke of Ormonde had succeeded the Earl of Rochester to the post in 1703, and was Viceroy until 1707.'}

{"Allan Maconochie, the Scottish judge, was born on 26 January 1748. He was the son of Alexander and Isabella Maconochie, Meadowbank Estate, Kirknewton (now in West Lothian), to the west of Edinburgh. He was privately educated by Dr. Alexander Adam (1741-1809) who later on became Rector of the Royal High School in the city. Maconochie then studied at Edinburgh University taking the classes of Adam Fergusson, Professor of Moral Philosophy, and Hugh Blair, Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres. He also studied Roman Law with the Professor of Civil Law, Robert Dick, from 1766 to 1769. He was then apprenticed to Thomas Tod, a well-known Writer to the Signet. During this period he co-founded the Speculative Society, an institution which 'trained' young men in 'public speaking, talent, and liberal thought'. On the conclusion of his studies in 1768, he went to Paris for a short time. In 1770 he became an Advocate and in Spring 1771 was admitted as a student of Lincoln's Inn, though he was never called to the English Bar. In 1773, he returned to France. On 11 November 1774, Maconochie married Elizabeth Welwood, a daughter of Robert Welwood of Garvock and Pitliver, Fife, and grand-daughter of Sir George Preston of Valleyfield. Also in 1774 he was elected to the General Assembly as a lay representative of the Burgh of Dunfermline. On 16 July 1779 Maconochie was appointed Professor of Public Law and Law of Nature at Edinburgh University, and also in 1779 he was elected Treasurer of the Faculty of Advocates. At the University, he advertised classes each year until he resigned the Chair in 1796. In 1788 he became Sheriff-Depute of Renfrewshire, and in 1796 he succeeded the judge and essayist Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby (1745–1795) as an ordinary Lord of Session taking his seat on the Bench on 11 March as Lord Meadowbank. Maconochie had also been a keen agriculturalist and he wrote anonymously theDirections for preparing manure from peat, and instructions for foresters(1802) which was reprinted in 1815 and 1842. Other publications includedConsiderations on the introduction of jury trial in civil cases into Scotland(1814) andEssay on the origin and structure of the European legislatures(1788). A portrait of Maconochie was said to have been painted by Sir Henry Raeburn in 1814. Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank, died at Coates House, near Edinburgh, on 14 June 1816. He was buried in the private burial-ground on the Meadowbank Estate, Kirknewton. At his death he had been a Senator of the College of Justice, one of the Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, a Lord Commissioner of the Jury Court, and Vice-President of the Royal Society. Lord and Lady Meadowbank had four sons - the Scottish judge Alexander Maconochie-Welwood (1777-1861); Robert Maconochie (d. 1858) who became Mint Master in Madras, India; James Allan Maconochie (d. 1854), Sheriff of Orkney and Shetland; and, Thomas Tod Maconochie (d.1847).

{"The composer (Jakob Ludwig) Felix Mendelssohn (-Bartholdy) was born on 3 February 1809 in Hamburg. Already as a boy he was writing music with skill and maturity. He first studied with his mother, and then studied in Berlin with various teachers, and then in Paris. HisOverture to a Midsummer Night's Dreamwas written in 1826 when he was seventeen. In the early 1830s he travelled widely in Europe and hisHebridesoverture was inspired by a visit to Scotland in 1829. Mendelssohn was the favourite composer of Queen Victoria and hisScottish Symphonyis dedicated to her. Mendelssohn became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1835, and he founded the Leipzig conservatory of music in 1843. Both he and Robert Schumann taught there. Felix Mendelssohn died in Leipzig on 4 November 1847. The Scottish composer John Thomson (1805-1841) was the first Reid Professor of Music Theory at Edinburgh University. Thomson was well acquainted with Mendelssohn having first met him in Edinburgh in 1829.

His work includes theNapolo Poemsand the playThe rain-maker. Another early writer at Chancellor College was the poet Jack Mapanje (b. 1944) who had grown up in the newly independent Malawi under the dictatorship of Dr. Hastings Banda. He was a founding member of the Malawi Writers' Group (or Writers Workshop) which was formed in April 1970 in a deliberate attempt to build a Malawian written literature. The Group met weekly at the College and provided its members with a sympathetic audience for their own poems and stories. Through the groups' gatherings they succeeded in avoiding the control of the official government censor. Though the Group was confined to Chancellor College, it attracted contributions from journalists, teachers and businessmen. The Group became the only forum in which Malawian affairs were freely discussed. Mapanje became a Lecturer in English at the College in 1975, and he published his first collection of poems in London in 1981 -Of chameleons and gods. In 1987, by which time he had become Head of the Department of English, he was detained by police acting for Malawi Special Branch and remained in detention at Mikuyu Maximum Security Detention Centre for three and half years without trial. His poems inThe Chattering Wagtails of Mikuyu Prison(1993) were composed while he was imprisoned, as well as most of his third collection of poetry,Skipping without Ropes(1998). More recently he taught a degree course at the University of Leeds, 1993-96, in England, and has been teaching as a Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at the University of Newcastle also in England."}

{"The Main Library building of Edinburgh University Library was opened on George Square, Edinburgh in 1967. The new building was designed by J. Hardie Glover and Andrew Merrylees of the Sir Basil Spence partnership Spence, Glover & Ferguson (Edinburgh). Planning started in 1963 and construction began in March 1965. The building featured external materials such as Portland stone, concrete and glass, and interior finishes included teak, white beech, glazing, carpet tiling, and quartzite flooring. Furnishings in the building included Danish chairs in black plywood and stainless steel. When the new Library building was completed in September 1967, Edinburgh University Library began the move of some 2-million books from its old location, Playfair Library in the Old Quad' (designed by Robert Adam). Although the Main Library building has provided excellent space through its 40 year history, by the 2000s it was struggling to provide the facilities and working spaces required for 21st century methods of teaching, learning and research. In addition, four decades of wear and tear on the building meant that it was in need of a comprehensive upgrade. The University has invested £60 million in refurbishing the building to make it fir for new purpose. The article in the 1968 magazine piece featured in this collection was Jim Burgess, and the photographer was Henk Snoek (1915-1980). Snoek was said to be 'one of Britain's most accomplished architectural photographers', and worked for architects as diverse as Basil Spence and Yorke Rosenberg and Mardall. He was born in the Netherlands, and he studied at the Hague School of Art. Snoek's photography reflected the Bauhaus principles on which the Hague School of Art was run, and was 'characterised by a strong sense of drama, simple, forceful lines and high contrasts'."}

{"Materia medica is the Latin medical term for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing - it is 'medicines', or 'materials used for medicine'. In modern terms, this is 'pharmacology'. The treatise of materia medica, or compilation of medical substances, that forms this manuscript collection might be called a 'pharmacopoeia'. The earliest such compilations were those supporting the (Ayurvedic) system of traditional Indian medicine from the 6th century BC. There were Greek and Chinese compilations too, then those from the later medieval Islamic world. In 1025, Avicenna, the Perisan polymath, physician and philosopher, introduced hisCanon of medicinewhich is considered the first pharmacopoeia. By the 13th century AD, Ibn al-Baitar (from Andalusia) had described more than 1,400 different plants, foods and drugs, over 300 of which were his own original discoveries. His teacher, the botanist Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, introduced scientific techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, separating unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. This allowed the study of materia medica to evolve into the science of pharmacology. North Vigor, from England, was awarded his M.D. from Edinburgh University in 1747. His thesis or dissertation wasDe Diabete. It was during studies at Edinburgh, and attending classes offfered by Dr. Charles Alston, that he would have written down the notes of materia medica that comprise this collection. Vigor became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 1758. Charles Alston was born at Eddlewood (now part of Hamilton). He was educated in Glasgow, and then went to Leyden in the Netherlands to study medicine under Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). There he met Dr. Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767). Together, on their return to Edinburgh, they revived medical lectures at the University with Alston being appointed Lecturer in Botany and Materia Medica. He was also Superintendent of the Botanic Garden. Alston published various medical papers and an index to the plants in the Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. In hisTirocinium Botanicum Edinburgense(1753), he attacked the Linnaean system of classification. Dr. Charles Alston died on 22 November 1760."}

{"In the 17th century, glass slides were already being projected using a 'magic lantern' - or early form of the projector. However, in 1850, in Philadelphia, USA, the transparent positive image of a photograph in the form of a glass slide was invented by William and Frederick Langenheim - two Daguerreotypists. Their 'hyalotype' (from Greek 'hyalo' for glass) or black and white photographic glass slide could be projected onto a wall or screen using a 'magic lantern' lit by oil lamps. By 1870, limelight - a dazzling white light produced by directing a very hot flame onto the surface of a pellet of lime - offered a better, although more dangerous, form of illumination. The earliest and simplest form of limelight was the oxy-calcium lamp. The flame of a spirit lamp was placed near the pellet of lime and a jet of oxygen was used to raise the temperature of the flame and force it against the surface of the lime to produce its brilliant white light. An even brighter limelight could be produced using an oxygen and hydrogen jet. In the 1890s, the invention of the carbon arc lamp, followed by electric light, provided a safe method for displaying the lantern slide image. By 1873, Bruno Meyer, a German art historian at the Polytechnic Institute in Karlsruhe, was using projected lantern slides in art history lectures, and actually started to manufacture what he called 'glasphotogramme' which he sold at two marks a piece. When the new electric 'magic lantern' projectors were introduced in 1892, the technology was enthusiastically adopted by Hermann Grimm, a professor of art history at the University of Berlin. In an article published in 1897, he reported how lantern slides permitted the projection of works full-size, or allowed small works or fragments to be enlarged to colossal scale. Grimm's successor at Berlin was Heinrich Wölfflin who also embraced the new technology In 1916, a process for producing colour lantern slides had been invented by the German company Agfa, but because of the war it did not become available outside Germany until the 1920s. Use of lantern slides lasted until the 1950s when their popularity began to decline with the introduction of smaller transparencies and then, finally, in 1936, the discovery of the Kodachrome three-color process made the 35mm format slides less expensive to produce than lantern slides. Beginning in 1938, the transparencies were presented in the now familiar card mounts. Although the production of lantern slides ended in the 1950s, many academic slide collections still house and use glass slides. In some cases, the views that they represent are either drastically changed or no longer exist and thus they are invaluable images of the world during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."}

{"Angus McIntosh was born to Scottish parents near Sunderland, County Durham, on 10 January 1914. He was educated at Ryhope Grammar School, then at Oriel College Oxford where in 1934 he graduated with first class honours in English language and literature. Between 1936 and 1938 he was at Harvard and on his return to Britain he became a Lecturer at the Department of English, University College Swansea. During the Second World War, McIntosh initially served with the Tank Corps then as a Major in Military Intelligence during which time he was posted to Bletchley where he participated in the decrypting of German military communication Enigma codes. After the war he took up a lectureship at Christ Church Oxford and then in 1948 he was appointed first Forbes Professor of English Language and General Linguistics at Edinburgh University. At Edinburgh, he was the prime mover in the founding of the School of Epistemics - now Informatics - and the School of Scottish Studies, of the then separate Departments of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics. He was also behind two major dictionary projects and of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. While looking at returns from the questionnaire for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland, McIntosh realised the possibility of applying the methodology of modern dialect surveys to the investigation of past stages of the language. Middle English in its written forms exhibited high degrees of linguistic variation, known broadly to correlate with England's geographical regions. Experimenting with the Linguistic Survey data, he attempted to localise material from informants purely on the evidence of their written linguistic forms. The method which was devised - in what later became the Middle English Dialect Project - became known as the Fit Technique, and this was essentially an application of the principles of set theory to geographical distributions. It was to revolutionise dialect research in historical linguistics.A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English, or LALME, was published in 1986, 34 years after its inception, and enthusiastically received in the scholarly community. LALME led the advent of variationist methodology in the study of the linguistic history. McIntosh did pioneering work for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland and this resulted in the publication in 1952 of hisIntroduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects. In the same year he set up the Joint Council for the Scottish Dictionaries. He was also a tireless supporter of both theScottish National Dictionaryand theDictionary of the Older Scottish Tongueor DOST. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Scottish Text Society - and later honorary president - and for many years he was a member of the Early English Text Society's council. He was a member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, and he was a fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Professor Angus McIntosh died on 26 October 2005, aged 91. That same year, the Departments of English Language and of Linguistics at Edinburgh University, both founded by McIntosh, merged."}

{"The Edinburgh University Sailing Club (EUSC) was founded in 1933 as the Edinburgh University Yacht Club. EUSC is one of the largest sports clubs within the University and its dinghy teams are the most successful teams in Scotland. EUSC is located at the Edinburgh University Sports Union, Pleasance, Edinburgh. Club sailing takes place at Linlithgow Loch, West Lothian, for dinghies, and Largs (Clyde) and Port Edgar (Forth) for yachting. The EUSC is a group member of the Linlithgow Loch Sailing Club. In the 1980s and 1990s EUSC meetings were held on Tuesdays in the Pleasance, and in more recent years at the Wash Bar, Mound, Edinburgh, on Wednesday evenings. The EUSC Cameron Trophy sailing event has been held at Firbush - the University's field centre on Loch Tay - and in the Firth of Forth (the 35th Cameron Trophy was hosted by the Royal Forth Yacht Club). The Trophy has traditionally been held over a weekend during Freshers Week at Firbush, or rather during the weekend immediately before the start of the Autumn term. Club records also show that there has been a Sailing Club Regatta held in in May. The Club has held grand social events such as the Edinburgh University Watersports Ball which was often held at the Prestonfield House Hotel, Edinburgh, but was, in November 1989, held at the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh, as well as dinner dances, Hallowe'en, Christmas and Burns functions. Some of these still happen, along with beer and skittles and pub quizzes. The above-mentioned Cameron Trophy had been presented by Lord Cameron to the Edinburgh University Sports Union in the early 1970s. Lord Cameron had served with the RNVR in both world wars and in the Second World War had held the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. He was an honorary commodore of the Forth Yacht Club and was awarded an honorary blue for his interest in Edinburgh University sport. He held a particular interest in sailing and so the Sports Union decided to invite the EUSC to run an annual regatta at which the winner would be presented with the Cameron Trophy which he had presented. Earlier in the Club's history the trophy was called the Lord Cameron Trophy. Lord Cameron died in 1996, aged 96."}

bioghist
{"Until the mid-19th century, broadsides provided the sort of information provided by modern tabloids. They tended to be single sheets of paper, unfolded, and printed on one side. Designed to be posted up in public places, broadsides were used for the printing of royal proclamations, acts, and official notices, and later on became a means of political agitation. Edinburgh's 'baillies', the officials responsible for this notice or broadside, were the city's magistrates who had administrative and judicial powers. In Scotland the office of 'baillie', also spelled 'bailie', emerged in the 14th century. Since 1975, the title has largely become a courtesy one. Those baillies present when this ordinance was issued in Edinburgh in November 1720 were: John Wightman, George Preston, Robert Grierson, and Hugh Hathorn. They were present as Baillies and Justices of His Majesty's Peace. The ordinance was intended to restrain the soldiers of the City Guard from the 'immoral practices of Cursing and Swearing'.

He was educated at Langholm Academy then at Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh prior to studying at Edinburgh University. After wartime service with the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1915-20, in Salonika, Italy, and France, he became a journalist in Montrose, Angus. There he worked for theMontrose Reviewand edited three issues of the first post-war Scottish verse anthologyNorthern Numbers(1921-23). In 1922 he founded the journalScottish Chapbook, advocating the revival of Scottish literature. Grieve was a Labour member of Montrose town council from 1923, but in 1928 he was one of the founder members of the National Party of Scotland (now the Scottish National Party). Later on however he came to accept Marxist philosophy. He was a formal member of the Communist Party from 1934 until 1938 when he was expelled, and rejoined in 1957. Indeed, in 1964 he was a defeated Communist candidate opposing Sir Alec Douglas-Home in a Perthshire constituency in the General Election. In 1929, he worked onVoxin London, and in 1930 was living in Liverpool, working as a public relations officer. Another spell in London followed. In 1933 Grieve moved to Whalsay in the Shetland Islands, staying there until 1941. In these wartime years, he worked as a manual labourer on Clydeside, 1941-43, and then on British merchant ships engaged in estuarial duties, 1943-45. After the Second World War, he lived in Glasgow, Strathaven in Lanarkshire, and then from 1951 in Biggar on the upper Clyde. As a poet, Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) was the pre-eminent Scottish figure in the first half of the 20th century, and was the leader of the Scottish literary renaissance. Indeed, he has been acknowledged as the greatest Scottish poet since Robert Burns. Grieve rejected English as a medium and wrote in an amalgam of various Scots dialects. Later on he wrote Scotticised English, and then returned to Standard English. His poetic work in these mediums, and under the pseudonym Hugh MacDiarmid, includedA drunk man looks at the thistle(1926),To Circumjack Cencrastus(1930),First hymn to Lenin(1931),Scots unbound(1932),Stony limits(1934),Second hymn to Lenin(1935),A kist of whistles(1947), andIn memoriam James Joyce(1955). Other works includeThe kind of poetry I want(1961),The company I've kept(1966),Celtic nationalism(1968),A lap of honour(1969),Song of the Seraphion(1973), andJohn Knox(1976). These titles represent only a very small proportion of Grieve's enormous output as poet, prose writer, editor, and translator. Grieve was writing well into the 1970s but died of cancer in Edinburgh on 9 September 1978."}

{"The Coronation of the British monarch King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra took place in Westminster Abbey (the Abbey Church of St. Peter), London, on Thursday 26 June 1902. He was the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Edward's mother Queen Victoria had died eighteen months earlier at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 22 January 1901. Edward, or Albert Edward, or Bertie, was born at Buckingham Palace, London, on 9 November 1841. His wife, Queen Alexandra was a Princess of Denmark, elder daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark. They were married at St. George's Chapel, Windsor on 10 March 1863. Before the death of his mother and his own accession to the throne, Edward held the title of Prince of Wales. No-one since Edward has been heir apparent to the throne for a longer period. During his reign, now called the Edwardian period, the office of the Prime Minister saw its first official recognition. Edward VII was the first British monarch to visit Russia. This happened in 1908. He had also assisted in modernising the British Home Fleet. His interest in seafaring and the Navy earned him the name of 'Sailor King'. Edward VII reigned from 22 January 1901 until his death on 6 May 1910."}

{"The Museum of Scotland, part of the National Museums of Scotland, was designed by the architects Benson and Forsyth. The firm had been selected as winners of an archictectural competition in 1991. The design received inspiration from Scotland's national building tradition, evoking the idea of castle, broch, tower house, and tenement. Materials used include external cladding of golden Clashach sandstone from Morayshire, and concrete, limestone, beech, and smooth plaster in the interior of the building. A roof-top garden offers views of Edinburgh Castle , Greyfriars Kirk, the Scott Monument, the city skyline generally, the sea, and the hills. The Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, was the first national museum project in the UK since the mid-19th century and it was opened by the Queen in November 1998. Professor Michael Lynch, Edinburgh University, was appointed as a consultant to the Exhibition Review Committee (ERC) which oversaw the planning of the building and the devising of the content."}

{"Florence Bruce Dorward was born in Galashiels on 28 August 1912. She was the eldest child of Norman James Dorward and Elizabeth Haig Bruce. Her father, and his brother Adam, ran the family tweed clothing manufacturing firm J. & J. C. Dorward of Galashiels. In October 1925, following the death of her father, Florence was sent as a 'boarder' to St. Trinnean's School, Edinburgh. However, when the family moved to Edinburgh in 1928 she became a 'day-girl' at the school. St. Trinnean's School had been founded in Edinburgh by Miss Catherine Fraser Lee in 1922 and when it opened in October of that year it had just 60 girls as students. It was located in a building at 10 Palmerston Road, just off Grange Road in Edinburgh. Miss Lee practised the Dalton system of education with an emphasis on self-discipline. Later, in 1925, the school moved to St. Leonard's House, off Dalkeith Road in Edinburgh, but the outbreak of the Second World War then forced the girls and staff to be evacuated to Galashiels, to Gala House. In the 1950s, a series of St Trinian'scomedy films was made, starring Alastair Sim, George Cole, and Joyce Grenfell, and with the school depicted as a quite unorthodox one and where the girls wreaked havoc. Florence left the real St. Trinnean's in summer 1930 and then attended the Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy which was located at Atholl Crescent, Edinburgh. In October 1931 she obtained a Housewife's Diploma First Class, and a Cook's Certificate From October 1931 to July 1932 Florence worked as a cook at Canaan Park School in South Oswald Road, Edinburgh, and between October 1933 and August 1935 she worked in Ettrick Road, Edinburgh - probably at a nursing home run by a Miss Eleanor Murdy - and then as a cookery demonstrator with the Southern Scottish Electric Supply Company Ltd., in Galashiels. Later in 1935, and until February 1936, she visited family in South Africa. Over 1938-1939 she was an Assistant Manageress at a Mackie's Buttery. During the war, on 29 June 1940, Florence Bruce Dorward married Thomas Cowan Steven who later became a Chartered Accountant and partner in the firm William Home Cook, Robertson Maxtone Graham, and Thomas McLintock. The couple had a son in 1942, and then a daughter in 1945. In May 1975, Florence gave her war-time wedding outfit, the receipts for it, and trousseau items, to the National Museum of Antiquities, Queen Street, Edinburgh, where it was displayed in the then 'Costume Gallery' a year later. She is also noted as having attended the St. Trinnean's School Reunion which was a 'sit down' buffet luncheon held on Thursday 22 October 1998 at the John McIntyre Centre, Pollock Halls, Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh. A look around the old school building had been planned too. A Reunion had also been held at the same place in 1985. Florence Bruce Steven died on 25 November 2008. She had been pre-deceased by her husband, 10 May 1988. Her old school, St. Trinnean's, had closed its doors in 1946 on the retiral of Miss Lee. St. Leonard's Hall which housed St. Trinnean's between 1925 and the outbreak of war is now within Pollock Halls of Residence, Edinburgh University, and has an administrative, hospitality and conference function. It was built in 1869 by John Lessels (1809-1883) in Baronial style. During the First World War the building was used as a Red Cross Hospital, and during the Second World War it became an Air Raid Precautions and Home Guard Headquarters. St Leonard's became a hall of residence for female students until the completion of the more modern buildings on the Pollock site from the 1960s onwards."}

{"James D. Macgregor was born in Invergowrie, near Dundee, on 21 August 1927. He was the son of Margaret (Robertson) and Alexander Macgregor. His father was Headmaster of the local school, Invergowrie Public School, the school attended by Macgregor until the age of ten. His secondary schooling was at Perth Academy. Between 1945 and 1950 he studied at St. Andrews University where he graduated with the degree of MBChB. After graduation, Macgregor worked in general practice in Perth and Bridge of Earn before becoming House Physician at Perth Royal Infirmary. In 1951, he was appointed as House Surgeon at the Royal Northern Infirmary in Inverness. Prior to his 'call up' to National Service he was serving at Scartho Infirmary (Grimsby District General Hospital) in Grimsby, north-east Lincolnshire, England. At this point, he joined the Colonial Medical Service and towards the end of 1951 he began a first tour of duty in Freetown, Sierra Leone (know then as the Sierra Leone Protectorate), at the Connaught Hospital there. By the age of 25 Macgregor had become Assistant Surgeon at the hospital. He also ran the Mental Hospital at Kissy which, even in 2006, is the only psychiatric facility in Sierra Leone. This first tour of duty lasted until March 1953. Macgregor's second tour of duty began with his appointment as District Medical Officer for Makeni District at its population of some 360,000 most of whom were spread over a very wide area. Assisting him were two doctors and an American missionary. This second tour lasted until the end of 1954 when he joined the Colonial Service as a permanent and pensionable officer. In April 1955, Macgregor married a student from Edinburgh and the couple then travelled back to Freetown where he was to serve at the Hill Station Hospital (now called Choithrams Hospital). In 1956 he was posted to Magburaka in the Tonkolili District of Sierra Leone and to a new hospital there. Promotion followed, and Macgregor was posted to the Solomon Islands (then known as the British Solomon Islands Protectorate) as Senior Medical Officer. The journey to Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, on Guadalcanal, took two months by an Orient Line vessel - SS Oronsay - to Sydney, then tramp steamer. While on the Solomon Islands three children were born to the family. In 1975 Macgregor returned to the UK with his family to take up an appointment as Chief Medical Officer for the Shetland Islands - the Shetland Health Board. In 1981 he became District Medical Officer in Perth - Tayside Health Board. He retired in 1993. In retirement he has acted as secretary for a variety of bodies and has also been Medical Officer for Tayside Fire Brigade and for Fife Fire and Rescue Service."}

{"David Smith was born in South Wales on 21 May 1930. He was educated at Colston's School, Bristol, and at St. Paul's School, London, and then studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he was awarded the degrees of B.A. (first class honours in Botany), 1951, and Ph.D., 1954. After National Service, his academic career continued with a research fellowship at Queen's and he was Harkness Visiting Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. Smith was back in Oxford in 1960, this time holding a University Lectureship in the Department of Agricultural Science, as well as an appointment as Royal Society Senior Research Fellow, then Tutorial Fellow and Admissions Tutor at Wadham College. In 1975, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Smith then held the Melville Wills Chair of Botany at the University of Bristol, and in 1980 he became Professor of Rural Economy at the University of Oxford and Head of the Department of Agricultural Science. In 1986 he was knighted, and in 1987 he was appointed Principal of Edinburgh University in succession to John Harrison Burnett. The published work of Sir David Smith centres on the biology of symbiosis and was initially concerned with associations between algae and fungi, and latterly with a variety of associations between algae and animals. With A. Douglas he publishedThe biology of symbiosis(1987). During his period as Principal at Edinburgh, the University was confronted by challenges in the area of teaching (staff-student ratios), in research (assessments), and in financial policy, but through the resourceful leadeship that Smith provided, the University had been able to strengthen these areas again by the time that he retired in 1994. Sir David Smith's portrait was painted by Scottish painter and printmaker Dame Elizabeth Blackadder (b. 1931) and it was unveiled on 21 March 1994. From April 1994 to 2000, Sir David Smith was President of Wolfson College, Oxford."}

{"The poet, Tom Scott, was born in Glasgow on 6 June 1918. He was the son of a Clydeside boilermaker. In the Depression years of the 1930s, the family moved from Glasgow to St. Andrews where an uncle of Tom had a stonemason's business. After a brief apprenticeship to a butcher, Tom became an apprentice stonemason. His poetic spirit first manifested itself in his singing voice (described variously as tenor, or bass). During the Second World War, although a pacifist, he contributed to the war effort - believing that fascism had to be fought against - through his service in the Pay Corps. It was at this time he began to write poetry. Scott's earlier work was in English, and after the war, settling in London, his circle included Kathleen Raine, and Dylan Thomas. Visits to Europe encouraged his Scots poetic voice and he translated the 15th century work of the French poet Villon into Scots. Other work includedSea dirge,The ship,The tree,The dity business, andBrand the builder. In 1966 he completed a Ph.D on the work of William Dunbar which appeared as a book, and he editedThe Penguin book of Scottish verse(1970). In 1963, Scott had married Heather Fretwell and they wrote children's books. Their home was in the Portobello district of Edinburgh. In the 1980s, he contracted myeloma, a rare form of leukaemia, but he survived this. Tom Scott died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 7 August 1995."}

{"The Unit for the Study of Government in Scotland, now subsumed by the Institute of Governance, was acknowledged as the leading centre in the country for studies of Scottish society and politics. At the centre of the Unit's work was the study of policy-making and the political process in Scotland, set in a broad comparative and international context. Constitutional change in Scotland had been one of the Unit's central themes since its founding in the mid-1970s for which it drew on diverse disciplines, notably in Law and Social Sciences. It conducted The Scottish Election Study, which provided an in-depth account of how and why Scotland voted at the 1997 General Election, especially in the context of long-term changes in electoral attitudes and behaviour. A similar study had focused on the Scottish Referendum in September 1997. The Unit was followed by the Governance of Scotland Forum in 1998, and then by the Institute of Governance in 2002 A number of publications had emanated from the Unit throughout the 1980s and 1990s on a variety of issues, including pieces on the re-organisation of Scottish local government, management of councils, financing Scottish home rule, gender and Scottish society, labour market policy in Britain, citizenship, Scottish churches and the political process, women in Scottish politics, data protection and privacy, and democratic participation in the Scottish Parliament."}

{"At the time of his death in 2006, Professor William T. Baxter CA, was Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the London School of Economics (LSE). He had joined the LSE just after the end of the Second World War following periods spent as a student in the USA (at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard), as a part-time Lecturer at Edinburgh University, and as Professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. While in Edinburgh in the 1930s, Baxter met Kenneth E. Boulding (1910-1993), economist, philosopher, poet and Nobel-nominee. Born in Liverpool, England in 1910, and an Oxford garduate, Boulding had held fellowships at Harvard and Chicago, and after a short spell of teaching at Edinburgh University went to the USA for good and finally settled at the University of Colorado. Boulding's first bookEconomic analysiswas an introductory text book which 'blended Keynesian and neoclassical economic theory into a coherent synthesis'. He believed that 'depressions are due to too little private spending and that governments should run deficits to end them'. Baxter is lauded for his theory of deprival value and its use in nationalised and private utilities in the UK, and for his contribution to the accounting standards debate. Professor William T.

{"The mathematician, statistician, writer, composer and musician, Alexander Craig Aitken, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 1 April 1895. He was of Scottish descent. He attended Otago Boys' High School from 1908 to 1912. On winning a university scholarship in 1912 he went on to study at the University of Otago in 1913, enrolling in Mathematics, French and Latin. Studies were cut short by the 1914-1918 War however and he enlisted in 1915 serving with the Otago Infantry. Aitken saw action in Gallipoli and Egypt, and he was wounded during the Battle of the Somme. After his hospitalisation, he returned to New Zealand in 1917. On the completion of his studies in 1920, Aitken became a school-teacher at Otago Boys' High School and the same year he married Winifred Betts the first lecturer in Botany at the University of Otago where he also did some tutoring. Then, encouraged by a professor of mathematics at the University, he gained a postgraduate scholarship which brought him to Edinburgh University in 1923. His thesis on statistics gained him the degree of D.Sc. in 1925 when he also joined the University staff as a lecturer in Statistics and Mathematical Economics. In 1937 he was promoted to Reader, and in 1946 was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. Aitken's publications include: jointly with H. W. Turnbull,The theory of canonical matrices(1932); with D. E. Rutherford, a series of Mathematical Texts; wartime experiences inGallipoli to the Somme: Recollections of a New Zealand infantryman(1963); and, posthumouslyTo catch the spirit. The memoir of A.C. Aitken with a biographical introduction by P.C. Fenton(1995). He made many important contributions to the many fields of his subject, particularly in the theory of Matrix Algebra and its application to various branches of mathematics. In his time, Professor Aitken was one of the fastest mathematical calculators in the world. While at school, Aitken had learned to play the violin, and later on in life he played both the violin and viola and composed pieces for performance by university groups. Professor Alexander C. Aitken died in Edinburgh on 3 November 1967."}

{"Stanley Eric Francis Booth-Clibborn, Church Missionary Society missionary in Kenya and Bishop of Manchester, was born on 20 October 1924 into the family that founded the Salvation Army. Throughout his life he sought to combine his belief in Christianity with the promotion of social justice and the support of the poor and oppressed. He spent four years in the army, including two in India, then went to Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA (1951) and MA (1956). In 1950 he had studied at Westcott House in Cambridge and in 1952 he was ordained a deacon and a year later a priest. His first posts as a curate were in Sheffield (1952-56) but he was then accepted as a missionary to Kenya. Booth-Clibborn arrived in Africa in 1956 where he was to have varied ecumenical responsibilities included editingRockandTarget, influential church newspapers in East Africa. He was especially concerned to promote church unity and the development of the African church leadership during the political upheaval around the time of the Mau Mau rebellion. On returning to England in 1967 Booth-Clibborn became a minister in Lincoln but was also involved with the International Affairs Department of the British Council of Churches, and his wife Anne (nee Forrester) was Vice-Chair of Christian Aid for a time. He then moved to Cambridge in 1970 spending 9 years at St Mary the Great. From 1979 he was Bishop of Manchester and regarded with great affection and respect even by those who disagreed with his with his views, he was, for example, a strong supporter of women's ordination. He retired in 1992 and went, with his wife, to live in Edinburgh. His interest in Africa had continued and the Booth-Clibborns were invited by the National Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), in co-operation with Christian Aid, to monitor the 1992 Kenyan elections.

{"Edward Gibbon Wakefield was born in London on 20 March 1796, eldest son of Edward Wakefield (1774-1854), philanthropist and statistician, and grandson of merchant Edward Wakefield (1750-1826) and author and philanthropist Priscilla Wakefield (1751-1832). He was the brother of William Hayward Wakefield (1803-1848), and nephew of Daniel Wakefield (1776-1846). Edward Gibbon Wakefield was educated at Westminster School and at Edinburgh's Royal High School. By 1814, he was serving with the British embassy in Turin, and in 1820 with the embassy in Paris. In 1826 however, he was convicted - with his brother William - of tricking a wealthy heiress into marrying him, and both he and his brother were sent to prison for three years. While he was in prison Wakefield studied colonial affairs and prepared material for publication into a work entitledFacts relating to the punishment of death in the metropolis(1831). He put forward a theory of systematic colonisation and enunciated his views inA letter from Sydney(1820), inEngland and America(1833), and inA view of the art of colonisation(1849). He saw a relationship between the social conditions in Britain and the notion of colonial settlement, viewing the latter as a chance for Britons to take their skills overseas under a familiar constitutional tradition and in a recognisable social framework. Land would be sold in small lots at moderate prices, with the funds gathered then being used to support further colonisation, and some self-government would be allowed. In 1834, the South Australian Association was formed with a view to founding a colony on Wakefield's principles. In 1838, Wakefield accompanied Lord Durham, John George Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham to Canada and influenced the new Governor-General'sReport on the affairs of British North Americawhich proposed uniting the Canadian provinces and granting them full control of their internal affairs. In 1839, he formed the New Zealand Land Company - an amalgamation of an earlier New Zealand Association and a New Zealand Colonization Company - with the aim of settling and guiding the colony of New Zealand. His brother William would control operations in New Zealand, while Wakefield himself would direct the Company from London where he could continue to argue his case with the Colonial Office. In 1849 he founded - with John Robert Godley (1814-1861) - a Church of England settlement at Canterbury in New Zealand. In 1852, Wakefield left England for New Zealand with his son, landing in Port Lyttleton in February 1853. At once, both father and son launched themselves into New Zealand politics, with the elder Wakefield advising the acting-Governor Colonel Robert Henry Wynyard (1802-1864). In 1854 however, he suffered a complete breakdown in his health. Edward Gibbon Wakefield died in Wellington, New Zealand, on 16 May 1862. His only son, Edward Jerningham Wakefield (1820-1879), who had written on New Zealand based on his earlier stay there, as well as politican, had been elected to the House of Representatives in 1854, representing a Canterbury constituency. He had accompanied his father to Canada in 1838, and first went to New Zealand in 1839, returning to England in 1845. With John Robert Godley, he edited his father's correspondence on the foundation of the Canterbury settlement with the titleThe founders of Canterbury(1868)."}

{"Will Freshwater was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, England, on 1 November 1872. He attended school locally and then was apprenticed to a local cabinet maker at the age of 14. Freshwater became a Sunday school teacher and began accompanying preachers from the town's Independent Chapel into some of the villages in the area. He also became interested in evangelical work at this time. On the completion of his apprenticeship, he went to Birmingham becoming a member of the city's Westminster Road Congregational Church in December 1894. He continued with Sunday school work and evangelised in lodging houses open-air meetings, and grew interested in the Church's missionary work which was fostered by the minister, the Rev. Charles Deeble. After discussing his ambition with Deeble, in 1899 Freshwater decided to become a full-time missionary, and in September 1899 he was admitted to Harley College, the headquarters of the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, in Bow, London. His training continued until January 1902 when he passed the examination of the London Missionary Society, and then he transferred to Livingstone College for a course in tropical medicine. Freshwater left London on 30 April 1902 bound for Africa aboard the 'S.S. Matabele' and to a tour of duty at Mbereshi Mission Station, 1902-1907 (Mbereshi being in modern Zambia). In 1908, during a brief return to England, Freshwater married Nancy (Annie) Swingler, a schoolteacher in Market Harborough. After a honeymoon in Edinburgh, he and his new wife returned to Africa and were stationed in Mporokoso, also in Zambia (then Northern Rodesia), and a first child - Bernard Bruce - was born at Kambole on 28 February 1909. During this tour of duty he was in charge of the Mission Station and was on the District Committee and the Translation Committee. After a brief return to Britain, the family was posted to Kambole in 1913 but when war broke out in 1914 they returned to Mbereshi which was further away from the border with German East Africa (territories which include modern Burundi, Rwanda, and mainland Tanzania) and any hostilities. Freshwater studied the local language - Chibembe - and contributed to the development of Central Africa through the fields of linguistic studies, language and translation, carrying out much work between 1920 and 1925. He participated in the translation of the New Testament into Chibembe. Between 1925 and 1932, he was in charge of the Mission Station at Kafulwe in the Lake Mweru district. After a brief spell in Britain again in 1932-1933, a period of ill-health followed his return to Africa and he collapsed in 1934 after a journey to Capetown. On recovery in Bulawayo, he was placed at Fort Rosebery where he continued with translation work on the Old Testament. However, he had to return to Capetown for an operation and in March 1936 he wrote his last few lines home to relations in Britain from the Andres Murray Missionary Home in Capetown. Will Freshwater died on 25 April 1936 and was buried in the Woltemade No.1 Cemetery, Capetown, South Africa. Nancy Freshwater returned to England in 1938 and died in 1959."}

The third is a typescript which forms a postscript to the second letter. At the time of writing, Geddes was living in his old age at Montpellier. As ever, Geddes is urging change and new perspectives. The letters are from Geddes to R. E. Muirhead, chairman of the National Party of Scotland, and they shed new light on his political role."}

{"Patrick Geddes was born in Ballater, Aberdeenshire, in October 1854. He was the youngest son of Capt. Alexander Geddes, and he grew up in Perth where he was educated at Perth Academy. He then studied under Thomas Henry Huxley at the Royal School of Mines, London, 1874-1878. He also studied at University College, London, at the Sorbonne and at the University of Edinburgh and at Montpellier, France. Geddes succesively demonstrated or lectured in Physiology at University College, London, in Zoology at Edinburgh University from 1880 to 1888, and held the Chair of Botany at University College Dundee from 1888 to 1919. At the University of Bombay, India, he organised a department of sociology and civics and held the Chair of Sociology there from 1919 until 1924. Although trained in Biology, Geddes had generalist interests and these soon led him to become a social geographer, practical administrator, historian, dramatist and philosopher. He involved himself in the renovation movement in the Old Town of Edinburgh and it was in the Old Town too that he situated his famous Outlook Tower, a museum of local, regional, Scottish, and world history. In 1919, Geddes who was 'considered one of the greatest living authorities in civics and social survey' was entrusted by the International Zionist Commission to plan New Jerusalem and its proposed university. He was also the founder - in 1924 - of the College Des Ecossais (Scots College), an international teaching establishment located in Montpellier. In the British Mandated Territory (part of which later became Israel), the new city of Tel Aviv (the White City) was constructed from the early 1930s until the 1950s based on an urban plan by Sir Patrick Geddes - a plan which reflected modern organic planning principles. He was also involved in Indian town planning work. Publications by Patrick Geddes include:Chapters in modern botany,1893;City development : a study of parks, gardens, and culture institutes,1904;Cities in evolution : an introduction to the town planning movement and to the study of civics,1915;Leben und Werk von Sir Jagadis C. Bose,circa 1930; jointly with Sir J. Arthur Thomson,The evolution of sex,1889; and, jointly with Victor Verasis Branford,The coming polity: a study in reconstruction,1917, andOur social inheritance,1919. Geddes was knighted in 1932, and Sir Patrick Geddes died in Montpellier, France on April 17, 1932."}

{"The collection is composed of three bound volumes being Sir John Fraser's journal of a tour made around the world in 1935. Each volume contains many pages of black and white photographs along with pages of typescript text describing the journey. The first entry in the journal is dated Tuesday 22 January 1935 and describes the Langholm Hotel and the start of the journey to Southampton to catch the ship (RMS 'Aquitania') bound for New York. A journey across the USA by train followed, via New Orleans, with San Francisco the final destination. From California Fraser would sail aboard the SS 'Mariposa' to Australia with stops in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Samoa (Pago Pago), Fiji, Auckland, and Sydney. The last entry is dated 19 February 1935 describing the Samoan islands and the crossing of the International Date Line. The second volume starts on 19 February 1935 just after the Date Line and almost on arrival in Fiji. The stops in Auckland and Sydney are also described. While in Sydney Fraser travelled to Brisbane and to Melbourne. He then resumed his sea voyage aboard the P&O vessel 'Narkunda' to Adelaide and onwards across the Great Australian Bight towards Fremantle and Perth. The final entry in the second volume is dated Thursday 21 March 1935 just past Western Australia into the Indian Ocean. The third volume starts with an entry dated Friday 22 March 1935 close to the midpoint of the Indian Ocean and near the Keeling Islands (or Cocos Islands). The ship sails on to Colombo (Sri Lanka) where Fraser takes a tour to Kandy, and then the voyage continues northwards up the Malabar Coast of India, past Goa, and towards Bombay (Mumbai). After Bombay the vessel sails towards the Arabian Sea heading for Aden, and then into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. At Suez, Fraser left the vessel for a trip to Cairo and the National Museum and Pyramids, and then on to Port Said to pick up the ship again. His trip then took him to Malta. The last dated entry is Friday 12 April 1935 and describes Marseilles and the journey by train through France to the Channel and then to Dover and London and back to the Langholm. Within the fist volume there are some photographs of (possibly) the then 'new' Golden Gate Bridge in construction. At some stops on the voyage (e.g. Samoa, Fiji, and Auckland) and in Sydney and across Australia, Fraser had been in the company of doctors and other medical professionals with knowledge of the areas he visited. In Brisbane he gave a lecture. In Melbourne he visited hospitals and listened to talks, and in Adelaide he visited a nursing home, a children's hospital and had lunch with former Edinburgh graduates."}

He established his court at Holyrood in Edinburgh, and a number of publications are associated with his time here. This is a curious collection of anonymous letters, apparently from a member of the refugee court, on a political theme. The provenance is unclear, but there is a loose note stating 'Pour mes pauvres petites filles de France' signed 'Louise' - and hopefully further research will identify her."}

The illustrator was Lady Elizabeth Ann Gomm (1807-1877). The subject of the work was the visit by Queen Victoria to France in 1843. In September 1843 the Queen and Prince Albert were the guests of Louis-Philippe, King of the French, and his wife Marie-Amelie, at the Chateau d'Eu, their country residence close to Treport. The British royal party arrived on the late afternoon of 2 September on board the newly completed royal yacht 'Victoria and Albert'.

{"In December 1542, James V of Scotland died after becoming ill after his defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss. He died a few days after the birth of his only surviving child and heir - a daughter - Mary, Queen of Scots. Next in line to the Scottish throne was James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, and he became Regent. Hamilton became a Catholic and joined the pro-French faction in Scotland, consenting to the marriage of the child Queen to the French Dauphin, later Francis II of France. The French king awarded Hamilton the title of Duke of Châtellerault. In 1548 the young Queen of Scots went to live in the French court. In 1554, Hamilton surrendered the regency to Mary of Guise, Queen Mary's mother. In early January 1554, within the first months of her formal Regency of Scotland, Mary sent a letter to 'Magnifico viro Domino Viglio Caesarie Matis Secreti consilii...' concerning the plight of two Scotsmen, Robert Landis and George Kincaid, who had suffered 'insults' and had been imprisoned by John Vitner of Berg. The letter shows Mary of Guise exercising her powers with one of the most influential men in Europe. The man in question was Viglio a Zuichem, or Virgilius - Wigle Aytta van Zwichem (1507-1577) - a Dutch statesman and jurist. Viglio was one of the most trusted ministers of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, and was President of the Council of Mechlin (Mechelen)."}

{"In modern terms, a discharge is the act or instrument by which a contract or agreement is ended. A mortgage is discharged if it has been carried out to the full extent originally contemplated or terminated prior to total execution. Discharge also means to release from some legal obligation such as the payment of debts. The act of disposing, is the transferring to the possession of another. It is the parting with, alienation of, or giving up of property. The final settlement of a matter and, with reference to decisions announced by a court, a judge's ruling is commonly referred to as disposition, regardless of level of resolution. In Scots law a feu is a right to the use of land in return for a fixed annual payment. Ownership of a property does not pass to a purchaser until the disposition is registered in the Register of Sasines or Land Register of Scotland."}

{"The letter signed 'James R' to Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, is countersigned by J. Holcroft. It concerns the succession of Sir Richard Bolton by his son Edward, as Solicitor General in Ireland, 'to hold, exercise and enjoy the same during our pleasure [...]'. It is dated 5 December 1622. Henry Cary, an English landowner and politician, son of Sir Edward Cary and grandson of Sir Henry Knevet, master of the jewel office to Queen Elizabeth and King James, was born circa 1575. He entered Gray's Inn in 1590 and Exeter College, Oxford, in 1593, at a young age. Cary served in France and the Low Countries. Cary sat in the House of Commons from 1601 to 1622, and was created Viscount Falkland in the Scottish peerage in 1620. He was appointed to succeed Sir Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison, as Lord Deputy of Ireland. His patent was sealed in March 1622 and he was sworn on 18 September 1622. Cary died in September 1633 after breaking his leg which then had to be amputated. Sir Richard Bolton, an English lawyer, was born circa 1570. He practised for a time as a barrister in England, but left for Ireland with the intention, it has been alleged, of avoiding the results of a censure passed on him by the court of Star-chamber. At the end of 1604 he obtained employment as temporary Recorder of Dublin, and was confirmed in the post in 1605. By the end of 1618 Bolton was appointed Solicitor-general for Ireland, and he became Attorney-General to the Court of Wards at Dublin in 1622, and was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1625. Bolton's son Edward succeeded him as solicitor-general in Ireland in 1622, and as chief baron in 1640. Sir Richard Bolton died in November 1648."}

{"James Richardson had been an Egyptologist. He died in 1877. Egyptology is the study of pharaonic Egypt, spanning the period circa 4500 BC to AD 641. Egyptology began when the scholars accompanying Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt (1798-1801) published Description de l'Egypte (1809-28), which made large quantities of source material about ancient Egypt available to European scholars. Written Egyptian documents date to circa 3350 BC when the first pharaohs developed a writing system employing characters in the form of pictures. These individual signs, called hieroglyphs, may be read either as pictures, as symbols for pictures, or as symbols for sounds. The name 'hieroglyphic' (from the Greek word for 'sacred carving') is first encountered in the writings of Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC."}

The letter of 17 January 1921 begins, 'I have just found, to my much delight, Mrs Kennedy Fraser's invitation to your wedding, wh. reached me at Betty-Fold, our house at the Lakes'. Holiday had hoped to attend, 'but when I unpacked the invitation had disappeared'. He continues by talking about the church. 'I was christened in All Souls Church and my parents were married there about 90 years ago. He goes on to say that he 'felt some hesitation in addressing you as patuffa, knowing as i do that marriage alters much in peoples relations to their friends [...] Please tell Mr. Hood that June 17th was my 81st birthday [...] and when he hears what a very old fogey I am I hope he will think that the friendship is a safe one'. he asks, 'Are you keeping up your beautiful singing and yr. cultivation of the Songs of the Hebrides'. In the letter of 8 February 1921, Holiday writes that he is 'afraid to seem like pestering' her, but wants to tell her how pleased he is to be back in touch, and how much he is looking forward to seeing the Hoods when they are in London. 'How amusing to hear that you came across my book. Did you really get all through it without fainting in the effort. It was brave of you to tackle it'. The third letter of 17 February 1922, Holiday apologises for forgetting her married name, and thanks her for the invitation to a concert. 'I am so busy that I consider it almost criminal to indulge in a daytime concert but I can't help that - I'm coming with my friend Miss Scott'."}

{"The American photographer and stereoscopic view publisher Benjamin West Kilburn was born in Littleton, New Hampshire, USA on 10 December 1827. After his education he became a partner with his father in the Josiah Kilburn and Son foundry, producers of stoves. Kilburn was a mountaineer, and he had climbed on Mount Washington in New Hampshire, in Colorado, and in the Sierra Nevada of California, and in Yosemite. Meanwhile, his brother, Edward Kilburn (1830-1884), was learning photography from a local daguerreotypist. The stereoviews taken by the Kilburn Brothers date from about 1865 and they became famous for landscape images of early North American state, provincial, and national parks and for the visual record of the great migrations at the end of the 19th century. Edward Kilburn retired from the partnership in about 1877 and the new B. W. Kilburn and Company brought many changes in stereoscopic technology and in the audience for the views. He was the world's most extensive manufacturer of stereoscopic views from 1890 - 1910. He also developed early fire-fighting apparatus, and was involved in search and rescue on Mount Washington.

{"The renowned American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens was born on 1 March 1848 in Dublin. He was raised in New York, though he travelled to Europe for further training and artistic study before returning to the city. He achieved success for his monuments commemorating heroes of the American Civil War, though he also had an interest in numismatics and designed the $20 'double eagle' gold coin for the US Mint in 1905–1907. He also designed the $10 'Indian Head' gold eagle coin. Saint-Gaudens created the statue for the Charles Stewart Parnell monument at the top of Dublin's O'Connell Street, which was installed in 1911. His low-relief memorial to Robert Louis Stevenson, who died in Samoa in 1894, can be seen in the Moray Aisle of St. Giles, Edinburgh. The memorial was cast in bronze in 1904. Saint-Gaudens, had been an admirer of Stevenson. Earlier, in Edinburgh on 10 December 1896, at a public meeting presided by Lord Rosebery, it had been decided that it was desirable that steps be taken 'to provide by Public Subscription a memorial in honour' of Robert Louis Stevenson. A first subscription list was published in May 1897, but in spite of wide support for the campaign insufficient money was raised for an open-air memorial. An approach was made to St. Giles for a mural monument. Saint-Gaudens visited Edinburgh in January 1899 to select a site for the memorial in the building and after various delays, it was placed into position in March 1904. Other Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial committee office bearers were Professor Masson, Edinburgh (Chairman), and J. H. Napier, Edinburgh (Secretary)."}

{"The first letter on University of Edinburgh embossed notepaper, dated 3 February 1865, begins 'My Dear Sir' and sends his 'sincere thanks for the present' of a book. Blackie is sorry that he is 'too much occupied at present to allow [...] the p[leasure of reading it; but the subject is so interesting and important' that hw ill make time soon. The second letter on notepaper headed 24 Hill Street, Edinburgh, is dated 25 November [no year], and begins 'My Dear Moir'. It is a letter discussing a speaking engagement and for which he has been 'advertised [...] as a chief speaker'. He presumes 'it is merely a convivial affair - so there is nothing serious to be apprehended'. Even so, 'in case of blunders' perhaps Moir 'will be so kind as write to me, intimating what the nature of your society is', and what he is 'expected to do or to say'. He goes on to say that the 'more quietly I can escape the better' I hate these exhibitions'. While in London he will be staying in Kensington, at Phillimore Gardens. It is possible that the Moir in question is George Moir (1800-1870), a lawyer and translator of Schiller, and Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University,1835-1840. The third letter on notepaper headed 24 Hill Street, Edinburgh, is dated 29 November [no year], and also begins 'My Dear Moir'. He writes, 'Do not on any account suppose that I am a man to make complimentary speeches to men of whom I know nothing. Of Dukes generally I know nothing: the Duke of Argyle excepted from whose golden plates I have dined, and from whose sensible and thoughtful pages I have feasted my reason'. If he is to speak, 'give me something to speak of that I understand, and that has bones in it: but I had rather not speak at all'."}

{'John Stuart Blackie was born in Glasgow in 1809. He was educated at Aberdeen and Edinburgh Universities and also in Göttingen, Berlin and Rome, studying first Arts and then Divinity. He then turned towards the study of Law and was called to the Scottish Bar in 1834. An interest in the classics and literature brought about another change in direction and in 1841 Blackie became Professor of Humanity at Marischall College (Aberdeen University). He held this post until 1852 when he was appointed Professor of Greek at Edinburgh University. Blackie published a lot of material on philosophy, history and legal subjects and he translated Faust in 1834. He wrote much on Hellenic subjects too. He was interested in the reform of Scottish universities and he was a keen promoter of Scottish nationality raising funds for the establishment of a Chair in Celtic. Professor John Stuart Blackie resigned his Professorship at Edinburgh in 1882, and died in 1895.'}

{"Jessie Aitken Wilson was the sister and secretary of physician, chemist, and Regius Professor of Technology, George Wilson (1818-1859), who was also the first Director of the Industrial Museum of Scotland. Both were siblings of the anthropologist Sir Daniel Wilson (1816-1892). Another Wilson sister, Jeannie Wilson, married Frank Oliphant, the brother of the novelist Mrs. Oliphant (1828-1897). Archibald Wilson (1784–1843), a wine merchant from Argyll, and his wife, Janet Aitken, were the parents of Daniel, George (and a dead twin brother), Jeannie, and Jessie. On 6 October 1865, in her mid-life, Jessie Aitken Wilson married the much younger writer, James Sime (1843-1895). Their daughter would become the novelist Jessie Georgina Sime (1868-1958). In 1866, having given up the idea of entering the ministry, James Sime went to Germany, to study German literature and philosophy, first at Heidelberg University, and afterwards at Berlin. During his stay in Germany he collected materials for his Life of Lessing, and he visited most of the places connected with his hero and with Goethe and Schiller. On his return from Germany he settled in Notting Hill, London, in 1869, and began journalism. In 1871 he joined the staff of the Edinburgh Academy but, finding the work uncongenial, resigned and returned to London in 1873 to write. Both his wife, Jessie Aitken Wilson Sime, and his daughter, Jessie Georgina Sime, survived him. Jessie Georgina Sime moved to Montreal in 1907 and soon became involved in the city's literary and intellectual community. In her fiction and non-fiction, Sime was an early modernist and realist, and directed her attention to the social, economic, and emotional difficulties of working-class women and the urban poor. Her fiction includes Sister woman (1919) and Our little life: a novel of today (1921) the latter of which was reprinted in 1994 with an introduction by K. Jane Watt. Frank Nicholson, Edinburgh University Librarian and a long-time friend and writing partner of Jessie Georgina Sime, and eventually too, his widow, Mary Nicholson, became custodians of Sime's material which included family keepsakes."}

{"The Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for Public Service in India was a medal awarded by the British monarch between 1900 and 1947. It was awarded to civilians of any nationality who rendered distinguished service in the advancement of the interests of British India. The name, Kaisar-i-Hind, means 'Emperor of India' in the vernacular of the Hindi and Urdu languages. The word 'kaisar', meaning 'emperor' is a derivative of the Roman imperial title Caesar. It is also cognate with the German title Kaiser, which was borrowed from Latin. The medal was instituted by Queen Victoria on 10 April 1900. The title of Empress of India or Kaisar-i-Hind was taken by Victoria from 1 May 1876, and proclaimed at the Delhi Durbar of 1877. Following Victoria, Queen Empress, were the King Emperors, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII (briefly) and George VI. The Royal Warrant for the Kaisar-i-Hind was amended in 1901, 1912, 1933 and 1939, and while never formally rescinded, the Kaisar-i-Hind ceased to be awarded following the passage of the Indian Independence Act 1947. The Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for Public Service in India had three grades. The Gold medal was awarded directly by the monarch on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for India. Silver and Bronze medals were awarded by the Viceroy. The most famous recipient of the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal is Mohandas Gandhi, who was awarded it in 1915."}

{'This manuscript volume is contemporary with the period in which John Playfair (1748-1819), scientist and mathematician, was a Professor at Edinburgh University. Playfair had become Professor of Mathematics after Dugald Stewart (formerly holding the Mathematics chair) succeeded Adam Ferguson as Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1785. In 1802, he published his Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth, and in 1805 he exchanged the chair of mathematics for that of natural philosophy in succession to John Robison, whom also he succeeded as general secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The notes were probably taken down by a student.'}

{"Margaret Melville Rae Martin was born in Inverness on 4 March 1941. She was the daughter of Dr. Russell D. and Dr. Margaret Martin, and Dr. Martin was the Medical Officer of Health for Clydebank when he married. Margaret's paternal grandmother was Dr. Emily Winifred Dickson (1866-1944), the first female Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) who married Robert Martin in 1899. She was educated at Inverness Royal Academy, 1946-1956, and then at George Watson's Ladies College, 1956-1959, before studying at Edinburgh University, 1959-1965, and qualifying MB ChB in 1965. Martin enjoyed travelling, fed by an early visit to Poland. So, after training posts in and around Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, during which she collected the Membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1971 and the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, she set off for Ethiopia in 1973. From that year until 1976, she worked in Addis Ababa as a Consultant in the Obstetric and Gynaecology Unit, St. Paul's Hospital, in the city. She was also an Honorary Assistant Professor at the University in Addis Ababa involved in the training of nurses and midwives. On her return to the UK in 1976, after a spell as locum consultant in Paisley, she applied for and was appointed a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Newmarket General Hospital, a post she held until the inpatient unit was closed in 1992. She also held the post of Honorary Obstetrician with Cambridge Health Authority (Teaching). Martin maintained her outpatient clinics at Newmarket until her retirement from the NHS in 2001. Martin became a Fellow of the Royal College of Ostetricians and Gynaecologists in 1985, and she was also a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh). In the last few months of her life Dr. Martin received a Fellowship of the British Medical Association in 2005. Margaret Melville Rae Martin MB ChB FRCS (Edin) died from breast cancer on 22 August 2005. Her funeral was held at Coliston Parish Church in Edinburgh, and a memorial service took place in Woodditton Parish Church near Newmarket in September 2005."}

{"Vladimir Grigoryevich Tretchikoff was born on 26 December 1913 in Petropavlovsk, Russia (now Petropavl in Kazakhstan). His painting of a Chinese Girl (known as 'The Green Lady') had become one of the best known and best selling art prints of the 20th century. He was a self-taught artist painting realistic figures, portraits, still life and animals. In 1973 Tretchikoff published his autobiography, Pigeon's Luck, with Anthony Hocking, an account of his wartime experiences. Vladimir Grigoryevich Tretchikoff died in Capetown, South Africa, on 26 August 2006. In 1973, the Edinburgh department store, Patrick Thomson's Ltd., held an exhibition of his work. Patrick Thomson's - or PT's - was first established in 1889 as a small haberdashery and drapery store in Edinburgh. Located in South Bridge, the store lasted until 1906 when the company relocated to North Bridge. The extra space enabled the company to increase the variety of goods offered. Patrick Thomson Ltd was one of a number of large department stores in Edinburgh which included Maule and Son (later Binns/House of Fraser), R. W. Forsyth, both on Princes Street, J. and R. Allan and Peter Allan on South Bridge, Goldbergs at Tollcross, Parkers on Bristo Street, and Jenners. In the store's sixty departments, PT.'s sold boots and shoes, furniture, carpets, millinery and costumes, drapery and toys. There was a Palm Court restaurant, with views across Edinburgh, and an in-house orchestra. In 1952, the Scottish Drapery Corporation, the owners of the department store since 1926, were acquired by Glasgow-based House of Fraser, but in spite this, the store continued trading as Patrick Thomson Ltd. House of Fraser changed the name of the store to Arnotts in 1976, but the store continued to be referred to as P.T.'s until its closure in 1982. Since 1984 the site has become the Carlton Hotel - 200 rooms, plus conference and event space."}

{"From 1910, Maimie Waddell and Ruth Waddell ran the amateur Waddell Orchestra in Edinburgh which had been founded by their father in 1878. In 1926 Maimie Waddell started the Preparatory Orchestra (called the 'Baby' Orchestra) for children between four and ten. The Junior Orchestra was for those up to the age of 18. The Orchestra was funded by the parents of those children taking part. Concerts were performed free of charge. Over the years, the concerts were performed in St. Cuthbert's Hall (King's Stables Road), the Music Hall (George Street), and latterly in the Queen's Hall (Clerk Street). In March 1936, Maimie Waddell conducted the Junior Orchestra at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, alongside Sir Donald Tovey and the Strings of Reid Symphony Orchestra."}

{'The Tracy family lived at St Margaret, St Stephen, Ipswich in the early 1860s. The heads of the household were John Tracy, born in Rochester, Kent, and Mary Tracy, born in Lambeth, Surrey. According to the 1861 Census, the family was a large one, composed of: Mary C. Tracy, aged 40, a daughter who had been born in Scotland; Nathaniel Tracy, aged 31, a son, born in Lambeth, Surrey; Anthony Tracy, aged 23, a son who was born in Ipswich, Suffolk; Jessie Tracy, aged 22, a daughter, born in Ipswich; Agnes L.

{'Hamish Henderson, the folklorist, poet, soldier, socialist, songwriter, CND peace campaigner and anti-apartheid activist, was born in Blairgowrie on 11 November 1919. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. Having a gift for languages he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer during the Second World War. He served with the Eighth Army - in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy. This provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division\'s Farewell to Sicily. After the war, he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers\' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers\' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University\'s School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. Henderson\'s influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson\'s other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002. Michael Sharp was educated at universities in Britain and the United States. His Ph.D is from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Professor Sharp has taught in Scotland, Greece, Portugal, Nigeria, and at the universities of Binghamton, Harvard, and Wisconsin. He has been a Teaching Fellow in the International School of Theory in the Humanities at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Trained as a Romanticist and in the Literature and Ideas of the nineteenth century, Michael Sharp teaches in the University of Puerto Rico\'s Department of English where he is active in both the English M.A. and Caribbean PhD programs. His research focuses on the poetry of Anglophone Africa and the Caribbean diaspora. Michael Sharp\'s poetry has been published on both sides of the Atlantic. Sharp, Michael: "War pipes in Africa: the elegies of Hamish Henderson: London Magazine, April/May, 1983 Sharp\'s publications include War pipes in Africa: the elegies of Hamish Henderson which appeared in the \'London magazine\', April/May, 1983.'}

{"Sir James Crichton-Browne MD FRS was a leading British psychiatrist and medical psychologist. He is famous for studies on the relationship of mental illness to brain injury and for the development of public health policies in relation to mental health. He was also a celebrated author and orator. he was knighted in 1886. Crichton-Browne was born in Edinburgh on 29 November 1840. His parents were William Alexander Francis Browne (1805–1885) and Magdalene Howden Balfour, daughter of Dr Andrew Balfour of Edinburgh. The addition of Crichton to James's surname was derived from his godmother, Elizabeth Crichton, of Friars Carse, near Dumfries, whose family were instrumental in the financing of the Crichton Institution, Dumfries, where his father was medical superintendent (1838 to 1857). The young James spent much of his childhood at the Crichton. He went to school at Dumfries Academy and then to Trinity College, Glenalmond. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and qualified MRCS in 1861, and MD in 1862 with a thesis on hallucinations. Crichton-Browne was elected one of the undergraduate Presidents of the Royal Medical Society and, in this capacity, he argued for the place of psychology in the medical curriculum. He worked as an assistant physician in asylums in Exeter, Warwick and Derby, and a brief period on Tyneside. He was appointed Physician-Superintendent of the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum at Wakefield in 1866, and he stayed there for ten years. In 1875, Crichton-Browne was appointed as Lord Chancellor's Visitor in Lunacy, a position which involved the regular examination of Chancery patients throughout England and Wales. This post was held until his retirement in 1922 and he combined it with the development of an extensive London consulting practice. In 1878, Crichton-Browne became President of the Medico-Psychological Association, and in 1883, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (one of his proposers had been Charles Darwin). He also served as Treasurer and Vice-President of the Royal Institution from 1889 till 1926. He served as President of the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Natural History and Antiquarian Society from 1892 to 1896 as well. In 1908, he joined the Board of the Bovril Company.

{"Willa Muir was born Wilhelmina Johnston Anderson on the Shetland island of Unst in 1890. She was brought up in Montrose, Angus, before studying at St. Andrews - one of the first women to study for a University degree. In 1910, she graduated with a degree in Classics. She became Vice-Principal of a teacher training college in London, but left in 1919 when she married the critic and poet, Edwin Muir (1887-1959) who became one of the central figures of the modern Scottish cultural renaissance. During the First World War years, Willa Muir undertook postgraduate study in psychology and was interested in the then relatively recent work of Freud and Jung into the unconscious mind and the interpretation of dreams. The inter-war years saw the Muirs travelling Europe - the then new Czechoslovakia, Germany, Austria and Italy - absorbing developments in European literature and translating more than forty novels, the best known being works of Kafka. The more able linguist of the two, she was probably the main translator in these projects, also translating many books herself, under the name of Agnes Neill Scott. Willa Muir wrote only two novels: Imagined Corners (1931); and, Mrs Ritchie (1933). Both explored the conventions of small town Scottish life, and the effects of Calvinism, and the limitations experienced by women in these settings. In 1936 she wrote two extended essays: Mrs Grundy in Scotland and Women in Scotland, and these examined the roles open to women in contemporary Scotland. After the death of Edwin Muir, she wrote an account of their life together, Belonging: A Memoir (1968). She also wrote a study of oral poetry, Living with Ballads (1965). Willa Muir died on 22 May 1970. Vernon Phillips Watkins, born at Maesteg, Glamorgan, on 27 June 1906, was a British poet, translator and painter. He went to Swansea Grammar School, the preparatory school of Tyttenhanger Lodge, Seaford, Sussex, and to Repton School, Derbyshire. He briefly studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge, reading French and German, but did not continue, and worked in banking instead. Always, from a very early age, Watkins had been devoted to the English Romantic poets, and he himself emerged as a poet. He would become one of the very few metaphysical poets of the twentieth century and probably the most distinguished. He was a close friend of Dylan Thomas. During the Second World War he served in the R.A.F. Police and in Intelligence (1941-1946). He married a colleague of his from Intelligence in 1944. Watkins lived all his adult life in Gower, and after his marriage he lived at 'The Garth' on Pennard Cliffs. He received many literary prizes, and was awarded a D.Litt. by the University of Wales in 1966 and became a Gulbenkian Scholar at University College, Swansea. Vernon Watkins died in Seattle on 8 October 1967 during his stay as Visiting Professor of Poetry at the University of Washington."}

In 1861 he took up a position, with the Geological Survey, mapping glacial drift deposits in Central Scotland. This was supervised by his brother Archibald Geikie (1835-1924) whom he succeeded as the second Murchison Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh."}

{"A copy from perhaps 1763 of the manuscript account of the escape of Archibald Bower (1686-1766), a Scottish historian, from the Inquisition, 'Taken from his own mouth, by a Lady'. Archibald Bower was born at or near Dundee in 1685-1686. He was educated at the Scots College, Douai, which had been established in 1594 for the training of Scottish Roman Catholic exiles. Afterwards he went to Rome, and was admitted into the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1706. Bower then spent time in Fano, Arezzo, Florence, Macerata, and Perugia. The reasons for his flight from Perugia in 1726 are varied. Some say that he had been caught with a nun, but Bower himself said that it was because of the terrible proceedings of the Court of the Inquisition at Macerata, in which he said that he was counsellor or judge. He later returned to the Church of England. His own manuscript account of his escape had circulated in a number of versions during the eighteenth century. Archibald Bower died on 3 September 1766, and was buried in Marylebone churchyard."}

{"This MS letter, addressed to 'Dear Sir', was written by Violet Jacob at Domaine de la Congue, Vence, in the Alpes Maritimes, France, on 6 April [no year] and presumably in 1936, given the reference in the letter to 'the honour done'. 1936 was the year in which she received the LL.D. from Edinburgh University. Domaine de la Congue is the location of a French 'Maison de retraite', a sanatorium for veterans today. The letter tells of how the letter reached her 'after various adventures' and that there has been a 'delay in answering it'. She continues: 'I cannot say how kind I think it of you to write. You tell me that there are countrymen of mine who will regard the honour done by Edinburgh University as a personal honour to themselves.

{"The Scottish writer and poet Violet Jacob was born Violet Augusta Mary Frederica Kennedy-Erskine on 1 September 1863 in Angus. The Kennedy-Erskine family owned the Dun estate near Montrose. She was a great-granddaughter of the Scottish peer Archibald Kennedy (1770-1846), 1st Marquess of Ailsa (also known as Lord Kennedy, and as The Earl of Cassilis). Violet Kennedy-Erskine married Arthur Otway Jacob (d. 1936), an Irish Major in the British Army, on 27 October 1894. She accompanied him to India where he was serving (with the cavalry regiment, the 20th Royal Hussars). The Jacobs had a son, their only child, in 1895, Arthur Henry (Harry) Jacob. He died however as a soldier at the battle of the Somme in 1916, during the First World War, while serving with the 4th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers. The area of Montrose where her family seat of Dun was situated was the setting for much of Violet Jacob's fiction. In her poetry, she was associated with Scots revivalists. Her Wild Geese from 'Songs of Angus' (1915), takes the form of a conversation between the poet and the North Wind, and is a sad poem of longing for home. Her work spans five decades and includes: a novel, The Sheepstealers (1902); the historical novel Flemington (1911); short stories, Tales of my own country (1922); a history, the Lairds of Dun (1931); and, The Scottish poems of Violet Jacob (1944). On 3 July 1936, Violet Jacob, authoress, was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) by the University of Edinburgh. She was noted as a 'writer and poet' in the University of Edinburgh Journal, Vol. 8. 1936-1937., p34. Latterly Violet Jacob had lived in Kirriemuir, Angus, and she died on 9 September 1946."}

It continues by referring to an 'issue between Mrs Carswell and me' which 'is at once simple, and not simple'. Murry states that he does 'not doubt, for one moment, that her original impulse was one of good faith'. He writes, 'She felt it her duty to defend Lawrence against me'. That had been 'her first mistake' one 'made in absolutely good faith, but a mistake of the most serious kind'. Mrs. Carswell 'did not, and does not, understand' his work Son of Woman.

His literary career began in 1911 and his last book was publishe din 1957. Murry promoted the work of his wife, Katherine Mansfield, after her death in 1923, and his friendship with D. H. Lawrence inspired an autobiography of the great novelist. In the 1920s, Murry's interests shifted from literature to religious philosophy, and in the 1930s he converted to Marxism and then moved politically towards pacifism. His writing of the period reflected these shifts in interest. John Middleton Murry died 12 March 1957. In the 1930s a dispute had arisen between John Middleton Murry and Catherine Carswell (1879-1946). She had attempted to answer Murry's work on D. H. Lawrence through a work of her own but publishers Chatto & Windus had withdrawn her book because of threats of legal action from Murry. Martin Secker had reissued a revised version in 1932.

{"Christabel Harriette Pankhurst was born in Manchester on 22 September 1880. She was the daughter of lawyer Dr. Richard Pankhurst and women's suffrage movement leader Emmeline Pankhurst, and sister of Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst and Adela Pankhurst. She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls, and Christabel obtained a law degree from the University of Manchester. She was a co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). In 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a Liberal Party meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragist Annie Kenney, went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. She was jailed again in 1907 and in 1909. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris, to escape imprisonment under the terms of the so-called 'Cat and Mouse Act'. The start of the First World War compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. In prison she engaged in a hunger strike. A truce was declared and Pankhurst spoke out against the danger that Germany offered, and she toured the country making recruitment speeches at which her supporters handed out white feathers (a badge of cowardice) to non-uniformed males, though neither she nor her supporters spoke out for the right of women to march to the front as well. Meanwhile, in Russia, women served in the armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war, and their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes After some British women over the age of 30 were granted the right to vote at the end of the First World War, Pankhurst stood in the 1918 general election but was narrowly defeated. Only twenty years after that, British women had the opportunity to join uniformed services. Pankhurst left England in 1921 and moved to the USA where she eventually became an evangelist with Plymouth Brethren links and became a prominent member of Second Adventist movement. She became active in heralding 'the personal, visible, and powerful Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ as foreshown by the present signs of the times'. She returned to England in the 1930s and was made a Dame in 1936, but again left for the USA at the onset of the Second World War.

{'The Scottish poet and novelist George Mann MacBeth was born in Shotts, Lanarkshire, on 19 January 1932. When he was three, his family moved to Sheffield and he was educated at King Edward VII School in the city, before studying at New College, Oxford, with an Open Scholarship in Classics. On graduating from Oxford, he joined BBC Radio in 1955, working as a producer of programmes on poetry, notably for the BBC Third Programme, until 1976. He would then resign from the BBC to take up novel writing, and he introduced a series of thrillers involving the spy, Cadbury. After a divorce from his first wife, he married the novelist Lisa St Aubin de Terán (b. 1953), and then after a second divorce, he moved with his third wife to Ireland to live at Moyne Park, Abbeyknockmoy, near Tuam in County Galway. Shortly afterwards he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, dying with this in 1992. His work spans four decades and includes: A Form of Words (1954); the editing of the Penguin Book of Sick Verse (1963), and of the Penguin Book of Animal Verse (1965), and the Penguin Book of Victorian Verse (1969); Missile Commander (1965); Shrapnel (1972); the thriller The Samurai (1976); the thriller Cadbury and the Samurai (1981); The Long Darkness (1984); Trespassing. Poems from Ireland (1991); and, the novel The Testament of Spencer (1992). In the last poetry he wrote, MacBeth provides an anatomy of a cruel disease and the destruction it caused two people deeply in love. His Poems from Oby (1982) was a Choice of the Poetry Book Society. Macbeth received a Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for his work. George Mann Macbeth died in Tuam, Co. Galway, Ireland on 13 February 1992.'}

The letter, which is either an autograph draft or an edited version prepared for publication, condemns the forgery by Denis Vrain-Lucas (1818-1880) of letters of Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Denis Vrain-Lucas was one of the most notorious forgers of the nineteenth century. His forged letters of Newton and Pascal were sold to one Michel Chasles in 1861. Brewster writes that he is glad to see in the Scotsman the opinions of Professor Kelland and Professor Tait on the letters of Pascal and Newton. The forgery of the letters he writes, 'is proved by every variety of evidence internal, and external, direct and circumstantial, and not a single fact or argument has been produced to prove that they are authentic'."}

{'David Brewster was born in Jedburgh on 11 December 1781, and was attending Edinburgh University classes at the age of twelve in 1793. It was his ambition to go into the Church. Indeed, Brewster gave his first sermon in March 1804 but nervousness led him to abandon this career. That year he became tutor to a family in Dumfriesshire and he remained there until 1807 while he pursued scientific studies and the study of literature. In 1807, Brewster was a candidate for the Chair of Mathematics at St. Andrews University, but without success. In 1813, he submitted a paper to the Royal Society of London on Some properties of light and the same year he published a Treatise on new philosophical instruments. In 1814, illness prompted him to visit Paris and Geneva and on his return to Britain he continued publishing. In 1815, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1816, Brewster invented the kaleidoscope and although he patented the invention, it was quickly pirated because of a fault in the registration. He published his Treatise on the kaleidoscope in 1819. Together with the mineralogist Professor Robert Jameson, he edited the Edinburgh philosophical journal, previously called the Edinburgh magazine, and in 1819 when the name changed again to the Edinburgh journal of science he was the sole editor. In 1820, Brewster became a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and in 1821 he was active in the formation of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts of which he became director. In 1822, he became a member of the Royal Irish Academy of Arts and Sciences. In December 1837, he became the Principal of the United College of St. Salvator and St. Leonard at St. Andrews University. In 1859 he became Principal of Edinburgh University. Sir David Brewster died from an attack of pneumonia at Allerly, Melrose, on 10 February 1868.'}

At the time of the city's founding in the 18th century, the site was called the 'Grand Meadow', and military solemnities in the honour of victory in the Great Northern War against Sweden were held there. Later, it was renamed 'Pleasure Field' (Poteshnoe Polye), and in the 1740s it was turned into a park with paths, lawn and flowers. When Rastrelli was commissioned to build a Summer Palace for Empress Catherine I, the field was again renamed, this time as 'Tsarina's Meadow'. By the end of the 18th century 'Tsarina's Meadow' became a military drilling ground, and monuments to Russian victories were erected there including one to Alexander Suvorov in 1801.

He attended the Western District school in Perth between 1929 and 1936 and then went to the Central Secondary, Aberdeen, from 1936 until 1942, where he was advised to leave his studies due to his very bad eyesight. McFarland never heeded this advice, and studied for the degree of MA in Aberdeen, graduating with honours in English Language and Literature in July 1946. McFarland then came to Edinburgh to study Education, where he was a student of Godfrey H Thomson's, and graduated from Moray House with the Dip.Ed in July 1947. He was then a member of the Thomson B.Ed group in 1948, graduating in July 1948. Having become a close friend of Thomson, who recognised his talents and capabilities, McFarland joined him in a project on University teaching and learning. Initially, McFarland had been proposed by Thomson for a post in the Schools Inspectorate, which he didn't get because he was too young. McFarland worked for Thomson for about three years, from 1949 until 1951. It is possible that Thomson was intending to develop university entrance tests, through his Moray House 'brand'; tests like these had been used in the US since 1901, first as an achievement test and then, by the 1920s, as an aptitude or intelligence test, but they were not used in the UK. McFarland published several books and articles, as well as contributing to the Hale Report, which is regarded as one of the foundations of the study of university teaching methods. McFarland was a lecturer in the Education department St Andrews University until 1966, when he accepted the post of Professor of Education at the University of Durham.

His mother was Janet Jobson Henderson (d. 1933), a cook and housekeeper who had served as a nurse on the western front, and his father was James Scott (1874–1934), an army officer. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian, Jacobite maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. He also spent time in Dundee, Somerset, and Devon. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. In the world of the 1930s, the Depression, the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism, and Scottish nationalism at home, would each shape Henderson's worldview and political outlook. When war broke out in September 1939, Henderson attempted to enlist in the Cameron Highlanders but he was rejected because of weak eyesight. He was called up the following year, joining the pioneer corps. However, with a gift for languages, he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer in January 1942, and served in north Africa with the Eighth Army. His service in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division's Farewell to Sicily. During 1947 and 1948 he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University's School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. And, over and over again, Henderson's writings displayed a keen and deep appreciation of internationalism, foreign literature, and people's culture. Throughout his life too, he corresponded privately connecting with many of the finest minds of the day, and also wrote through the columns of national newspapers. Towards the end of the 1950s, on 15 May 1959, Henderson married Renate Felicitas (Kätzel) Schmidt (b. 1937) in Coburg, Germany Henderson's influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene too. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson's other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002."}

{"The letter is dated Doncaster, 26 January 1833, and addressed to Lady Campbell / Barcaldine / Bonaw / Argyleshire. It was written when the young Alexander was 13-years old, and begins, 'My dear Mamma'. The letter writes of making amends and promises to 'write much oftener than I have done previously'; of the 'nice cake' sent to him; and, of the receipt of a letter from Margaret who had said that 'Mary went to shower baths every other day'. The letter tells of how Christmas and New Year was spent, with the teenager going to 'Mrs MacDougall's on the Saturday before Christmas' and going to the Cathedral on Christmas Day. In York, he 'heard the Russian Horn band and went to the Circus and was very much amused with the horses'. The letter goes on to ask how the pony is and supposes that 'he has not been rode much since I left home'.

{'Prior to the foundation of the Scottish Council on Postgraduate Medical Education in 1970, governance of postgraduate medical education in Scotland was carried out by regional committees drawn from the Royal Colleges, University medical schools and the National Health Service. Following the Royal Commission on Medical Education report (often called the Todd Report) in 1968, the Scottish Council on Postgraduate Medical Education (SCPME) was established in 1970 with the purpose of co-ordinating, funding and advising on postgraduate education and training in hospitals, general practice and clinical psychology in Scotland. In October 1992 the SCPME was reconstituted as the Scottish Council for Postgraduate and Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE), and in 1993 it became a Special Health Board of the NHS. NHS Education for Scotland was established as a Special Health Board by Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 103, The NHS Education for Scotland Order 2002. The staff and functions of SCPMDE, including the South East of Scotland Postgraduate Medical Deanery, transferred to the new body in April 2002, together with those of the National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting and the Post Qualification Education Board for NHS Pharmacists in Scotland.'}

{"Russell A. Leather was born in 1924. He was educated at George Heriot's School and studied at Edinburgh University from 1948. His university education was delayed by wartime and his army service as a Captain in the Far East with the Royal Corps of Signals, 1942-1947/48. As in other instutions in the UK, studying at Edinburgh University in the immediate post-war period was challenging. Food and clothing were severely rationed and new equipment was in short supply. Test equipment and other mechanical machinery were of pre-war standard, but although out-dated it was capable of producing decent results. Although Leather studied electrical engineering, the first year curriculum was aimed at providing students with a broader engineering background. Mechanical devices, steel structures and electrical technology were all covered. In the pre-war period, the emphasis had been on civil engineering but this changed in the late-1940s when, under Professor Arnold, greater emphasis was placed on mechanical engineering. And, later on, under Professor Farvis, an electrical engineering curriculum was developed and this included electronics which, though still hollow state, would soon be dominated by solid state electronics. At Edinburgh University, electrical power engineering relied on equipment at the then Heriot-Watt College. After his studies, Leather worked on and researched into radar with Ferranti in Edinburgh and in Dundee. During his time with Ferranti he took out around 25 patents. Latterly he was Chair of the Gannochy Trust for seventeen years until 2008, and had been a Trustee for 40-years. Russell A. Leather BSc Hon LL.D. CEng.

{"The Edinburgh Ladies Education Association (ELEA) which was the forerunner of the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women (EAUEW) was founded on 15 October 1868 at 1 Inverleith Terrace, Edinburgh. The following year, Sophia Jex-Blake won the right for women to attend medical classes in the separate Extra-Mural School. The guiding force behind the setting up of the ELEA however, was Mrs Mary Crudelius who, with others, was able to use combined influence to win the guidance and advice of David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature, a prominent supporter of the women's cause. By 1873, women were enrolled in Association classes as diverse as Mathematics, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Physiology, Botany and Bible Criticism. In 1874 a University Certificate in Arts was introduced, and by 1877 the Rules and Calendar of the Association were being printed in the University Calendar thus forging the link between the University of Edinburgh and the cause of women's education. With a change in name (to EAUEW) the Association continued to attract students to its classes, and to campaign to obtain a university education for women. In the end, the debate produced the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889 which led to the drawing up of Regulations for the Graduation of Women and for their instruction in the Universities, 1892. In 1893 eight women graduated from the University of Edinburgh. They had all been EAUEW students. Right from the start, classes were mixed with the exception of medical ones. With its main objective now achieved, the EAUEW turned to the provision of facilities and amenities for women. By 1897, a library and accommodation for women were available at Masson Hall, at that time located at George Square, Edinburgh. By 1914 more than a thousand women had graduated at the University. The EAUEW was wound up in the 1970s."}

{"William Fraser was born in the Mearns, Kincardineshire, on 18 February 1816. After private education in Stonehaven, in 1830 he began a five-year apprenticeship with the firm of Messrs., Brand and Burnett, solicitors in the town. In 1835 he went to Edinburgh where he joined the firm of Hill and Tod, WS, and continued his education at Edinburgh University , studying Scots' Law and conveyancing. He also took classes in French. Many of the legal cases in which he became involved had required antiquarian and, in particular, genealogical research, and he was therefore introduced at an early stage to those studies in which he later on would became an expert. He steadily built up a great body of knowledge which made possible his great series of fifty or so volumes on the histories of between twenty and thirty of the leading noble and landed families of Scotland - the Stirlings of Keir, 1858; the Montgomeries, 1859; the Maxwells of Pollok, 1863; the Carnegies, 1867; Grandtully, 1868; Colquhoun, 1869; Carlaverock, 1873; Lennox, 1874; Cromartie, 1876; Scotts of Buccleuch, 1878; Menteith, 1880; Grant, 1883; Douglas, 1885; Wemyss, 1888; Haddington, 1889; Melvilles, 1890; Sutherland, 1892; and Annandale, 1894. Fraser was Keeper of her Majesty Queen Victoria's Records in Scotland, from 1852-1894. In 1882 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. In 1885 he was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath and in 1887 he was made a Civil Knight Commander of the Bath, being invested by Queen Victoria at Osborne House on 2 August 1887.

{"The letter signed by Hugh Blair to 'Dear Sir' (which may be his publisher, Becket, or De Hondt) expresses delight at the newly-published Temora which he thinks should boost sales of his own dissertation on Ossian. He writes that he has 'now Read Temora, from which I expect Ossian will reap additional Honour and You some profit. It is in Several respects Superior to Fingal; it is more full and particular, it is a more Complete Story'. he has learned too that 'the Sale of my dissertation has been quicken'd by Temora'. There is a transcript of the 2pp letter. The leaves of the original are detached, one supported on board. Dated Edinburgh 17 March 1763."}

{"Hugh Blair FRSE (7 April 1718–27 December 1800) was a Scottish minister of religion, author and rhetorician, considered one of the first great theorists of written discourse. As a minister of the Church of Scotland, and occupant of the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh, Blair's teachings had a great impact in both the spiritual and the secular realms. Best known for Sermons, a five volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, a prescriptive guide on composition, Blair was a valuable part of the Scottish Enlightenment Blair's publishers were Thomas Becket or Beckett and Peter Abraham De Hondt James Macpherson was a Scottish writer, poet, literary collector and politician, known as the 'translator' of the Ossian cycle of poems. He was born on 27 October 1736. Blair had arranged the publication of Macpherson's Fragments of ancient poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland in 1760, and it was Macpherson's Fingal of 1761 that prompted Blair to deliver the lectures that he expanded into A critical dissertation on the poems of Ossian, the son of Fingal published by Becket and De Hondt in London. The same publisher brought out Macpherson's second and final Ossianic epic Temora. James Macpherson died 17 February 1796."}
