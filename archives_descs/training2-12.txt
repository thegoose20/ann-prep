Biographical / Historical
"It is believed that the majority of the moss samples contained in this album were collected in Scotland in the early 19th century. This can be dated from the paper of the album which is watermarked as Robert Weir, Carron (Grove Mill), 1828. The unknown botanist collector has included many fruiting specimens from locations including Tarbolton, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, Newton near Ayr, Dean Castle Kilmarnock, Stair, Craiglockhart, Carrick Hill, Edinburgh College Yard and Dalrymple. Modern notes at the rear of the album suggest that the botanist was working to the classification used in the second edition of Muscologia Britannica (1827) by Sir William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865) - father of Joseph Dalton Hooker - and Thomas Taylor (1775-1848)."
