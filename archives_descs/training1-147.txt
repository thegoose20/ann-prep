"The sepia-tint head and shoulders portrait photograph is mounted on buff card. There is an embossed stamp for the Photographer, Russell, [75] Baker Street, London. Because of the London-based photographer, the portrait photograph is perhaps more likely to have been taken during Holland's period of office as Rector of Imperial College, London, 1922-1929."
