Biographical / Historical
'Christmas cards from James Geikie in 1874 were kept, possibly by his wife.', 'James Geikie was the author of a number of books articles in scholarly journals.', 'Presscuttings of obituaries notices were accumulated following the death of James Geikie in 1915.', 'James Geikie received a number of testimonials from distinguished scientists when he was applying for the chair of geology at the University of Edinburgh. He also published numerous scholarly articles in journals of organisations such as the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, covering such topics as glaciation, geological research, and specific aspects of the geology of specific locations within Scotland, Britain, Europe and the wider world. His son, John Somerville Geikie also published on the subject of gold at Sarawak.', "'Aunt Phemie' (possibly Euphemia Somerville Johnston) made a number of decorative cards with butterfly adornments.", 'Various portrait photographs were taken of James Geikie. Alongside these were kept those of his wife, family and other photographs.', "Certain items of Geikie family correspondence were photocopied and microfilmed as were a number of letters by Charles Darwin. The former consisted mainly of letters from John Somerville Geikie and William [Geikie] from Sarawak and Singapore and include geological observations (John Somerville Geikie later pubished A List of Sarawak Minerals). The latter partly concermed James Geikie's publication, The Great Ice Age.", 'James Geikie gave lectures on a number of subjects at the University of Edinburgh, including geology, mineralogy and palaeontololgy. He was also involved in organising the syllabus and field trips and in setting examinations.', 'James Geikie kept and used a large number of maps in the course of his work. As a member of the Geological Survey for Scotland he was involved in geological mapping and he also mapped geological features in other parts of Britain, in Europe and further afield.', 'Much correspondence was conducted between different members of the Geikie family, such as James Geikie, his wife Mary (nee Johnston) and children Mary Dorothea, John (Jack) Somerville, James Stewart and George Ramsay. Professional correspondents with James Geikie included Robert Boog Watson.', "James Geikie (1839-1915) was the leading British authority on Pleistocene geology. He developed the theory, through observations in Scotland and Continental Europe, that during ice-ages mild inter-glacial periods interrupted the glacial period as a whole. He originated the current belief that human habitation continued in Europe throughout the glacial period. Geikie undertook classes at the University of Edinburgh while working in a printer's office. In 1861 he took up a position, with the Geological Survey, mapping glacial drift deposits in Central Scotland. This was supervised by his brother Archibald Geikie (1835-1924). Geikie made his reputation with the book The Great Ice Age and its Relation to the Antiquity of Man, ( 1874) , the 3rd edition of which was fully revised in 1894. In 1882 he succeeded his brother, Sir Archibald Geikie as the second Murchison Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh. While undertaking his duties two seminal textbooks were published: Outlines of Geology, ( 1886) and Structural and Field Geology, ( 1905) . In 1889 Geikie was awarded the Murchison medal by the Geological Society, London and the Brisbane Medal by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was a founder member of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and the President from 1904-1910. For a period he also edited the magazine. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1875 and was President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh when he died.", 'In the course of his professional life, James Geikie exchanged correspondence with a number of geologists and other scientists at home and abroad.'
