Scope and Contents
'Showing hunting scenes and domesticated animals.'

Biographical / Historical
"The ms is an early or mid 19th century painted Burmese 'parabaik', telling the story of Singapatta ('Sangthong' in the better known Thai version), a story from the Buddhist Pannasa Jataka-Suvarnasankha Jataka. The story was so popular that it was later adapted and spread in the forms of 'jataka' in the monastic tradition and in the form of tale/performance in the secular tradition. This copy seems to derive from the secular tradition."
