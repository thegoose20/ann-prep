Biographical / Historical
"Edinburgh University Tea Club first met in the Upper Library Hall, Old College, Edinburgh University on 5 November 1920. It emerged at a time when the University was gradually opening itself up to female students. Although a Women's Union had been formed on similar lines to the student Union already existing for men, it was felt that women who were associated with the teaching staff of the University, either directly or through their husbands, would enjoy having a similar opportunity to meet socially. By 1945, the Club had flourishing tennis and badminton sections, an annual golf outing and a club for folk-dancing. There were also children's Christmas parties. In 1966, a flat within Edinburgh University property at Buccleuch Place was made available to the Club where newcomers could become introduced to members and which could act as a focal point for the Club."
