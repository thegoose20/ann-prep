Scope and Contents
"The unsigned letters, mostly from Edinburgh, were all written during November or December 1831. They describe a trip from Paris to Edinburgh, and life among the French refugees there. Although the last word has been obliterated, an inscription reads: 'Quoique l'auteur ne se nomme pas, tout le monde le reconnait pour M. le Baron de [...]'. On the inside of the front cover is pasted a note reading, 'Pour mes pauvres petites filles de France', and signed Louise."

Biographical / Historical
"Henri V, the legitimist King of France from the abdication of Charles X in 1830 until his death in 1883, went into exile when Louis-Philippe was proclaimed king in August 1830. He established his court at Holyrood in Edinburgh, and a number of publications are associated with his time here. This is a curious collection of anonymous letters, apparently from a member of the refugee court, on a political theme. The provenance is unclear, but there is a loose note stating 'Pour mes pauvres petites filles de France' signed 'Louise' - and hopefully further research will identify her."
