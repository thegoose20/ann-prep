Biographical / Historical
"From 1910, Maimie Waddell and Ruth Waddell ran the amateur Waddell Orchestra in Edinburgh which had been founded by their father in 1878. In 1926 Maimie Waddell started the Preparatory Orchestra (called the 'Baby' Orchestra) for children between four and ten. The Junior Orchestra was for those up to the age of 18. The Orchestra was funded by the parents of those children taking part. Concerts were performed free of charge. Over the years, the concerts were performed in St. Cuthbert's Hall (King's Stables Road), the Music Hall (George Street), and latterly in the Queen's Hall (Clerk Street). In March 1936, Maimie Waddell conducted the Junior Orchestra at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, alongside Sir Donald Tovey and the Strings of Reid Symphony Orchestra."
