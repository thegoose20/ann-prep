Scope and Contents
"The signed letter of two manuscript pages is on a printed letterhead - Windlesham, Crowborough, Sussex. It is dated 14 February, no year. The recipient is unidentified but the letter is in response to a question on Spiritualism. The letter states that, 'the reports of the psychic disturbances at Mount Sorrel are very consistent with those which break out so often in what are called polter-geist hauntings. Many hundreds of these are on record, the more famous being that at Epworth in 1716 which was carefully reported by the father of John Wesley. The young daughter Emily Wesley was the involuntary medium on this occasion, for the sounds followed her through life...'. There is some pencilled shorthand notes on the verso of the second page."
