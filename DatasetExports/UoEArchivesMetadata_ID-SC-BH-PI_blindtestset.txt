The letter is written on the reverse of a preliminary notice for the Twelfth International Congress of Psychology.", "Contains short letter from Thomson thanking Ledermann for the return of a manuscript copy of The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, and pointing out an error in his formula; a post script from Thomson regarding an error in Burt's matrix; and a post script from Thomson regarding Ledermann's notes about when a Heywood battery becomes impossible.", 'Thomson refers to his previous letters regarding correlation co-efficients in a doubly centred matrix. He tells Ledermann he was wrong in some respects, and asks him further questions in relation to the work of Burt.', 'Thomson also wishes Ledermann and his family a Happy New Year, and asks Ledermann about the university examinations process in Germany, telling him of his own experience. Thomson discusses dice throwing, referring to his own article, a Hierarchy without a General Factor, from the British Journal of Psychology, and his own experiments with dice. The letter is written on the back of several tables and graphs regarding intelligence. It is unclear which report or article these are from, but they feature titles including Reading and Spelling: differences in mean AQ for LE and RE boys and girls; Reading Accomplishment in association with Incidence of Left-and Right-eye dominancy; Distribution of IQs in association with incidence of Left- and Right eye Dominancy; and Percentages of Total Retarded Group in Categories of Accomplishment and Intelligence.

He also informs Ledermann that he has ordered Darmois' book, Methodes d' Estimation, and asks him if he thinks it worthwhile buying a copy of Cullis' Matrices and Determinoids. Thomson advises Ledermann to keep account of postage and expenditure so he can be reimbursed for these, and informs him of his whereabouts for the next few months in order to arrange a meeting time.", "Thomson thanks Ledermann for the sheets, though concludes they were not of great value. He refers to trying times, sending Ledermann good wishes and stating that they will pass. He informs Ledermann that he almost has the calculations accurate, which will allow for the further analysis discussed in previous letters. He tells Ledermann about Hector's travels in Cyprus studying Byzantine buildings, confiding that he isn't sure where he is now, but thinks he is possibly in the Eastern Mediterranean.", 'Thomson also invites Ledermann and his family to stay with Lady Thomson and himself in Edinburgh, referring to his improved health. He also tells Ledermann that he wants his view on an article in Psychometrika by A Finn.', "Thomson continues to discuss Burt's paper, The Correlation between Persons, from the British Journal of Psychology, Jul 1937, providing an alternative to Burt's formula, which he criticises as being unnecessarily complex.", "Thomson thanks Ledermann for his letter, and asks him to clarify some points for him. He refers to Thurstone's way of finding simple structure, and discusses reference vectors and primary factors at length.

He advises Ledermann with regards to referencing Kelley's pentad criterion in his paper, while still recognising Ledermann's shorter method for arriving at the same result. Thomson cites Psychometrika as the best publication for the paper, and offers to send it there if Ledermann is in agreement.", 'Thomson thanks Ledermann for his letter regarding minimum trace and minimum Thorstone [sic] rank which showed they do not always occur together, but Thomson argues that they usually do. He discusses matrices, referring to the work of Heywood, Spearman, and Thurstone; as well as an article that he would like to write.', 'Thomson informs Ledermann he will be speaking about their work on Factorial Analysis at a meeting of the Royal Society [of Edinburgh]. He asks Ledermann if he will also take part, along with Lawley. Thomson stresses that, although the lectures are to be delivered to scientists, the scientific audience come from varied backgrounds, and as such the lectures should be easily understood.', "In the first letter, dated 12 Apr 1938 and numbered 21 (38), Thomson tells Ledermann about his trip to Dumfries and the Galloway coast, informing him of his travel plans for the next few weeks which include going to Munich and Vienna. He asks Ledermann to undertake editing work on The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, in particular ensuring a second manuscript is up to date. Thomson also refers to the mathematical appendix he has completed and is sending on to Ledermann to ensure it is correct, and sends good wishes for Ledermann's tour.

Also includes a postcard, dated 21 May 1938 and numbered 21b (38), in which Thomson tells Ledermann briefly about his travels in Czechoslovakia and Sweden, and the professors he met there, and lets him know when he will be in Glenapp.", "The letter most likely refers to Y Ahmavaara's 1954 article, Transformation analysis of factorial data and other new analytical methods of differential psychology with their application to Thurstone's basic studies, from Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae. In the letter, Thomson asks Ledermann to check if he is correct in his interpretation of the paper, referring to a chapter on m.v. selection in The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, providing examples and working throughout.", "Thomson offers to change the date of his previous dinner invitation, and states that he has enclosed the Doolittle calculation along with the letter and card from M S Bartlett referred to in his last letter. These items have not survived in the collection. Thomson suggests that while Bartlett's letter is interesting, he does not agree that his estimates are unbiased. Thomson asks Ledermann to read through chapters three and four of The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability.", 'Thomson discusses the possibility of Ledermann applying for a temporary post at Swansea, and advises him to do so.', "Thomson asks Ledermann if he will look at Burt's article, The Unit Hierarchy and its Properties, and give his opinion.

Thomson and asks Ledermann if his family are OK, telling him they are in his thoughts.", "Thomson thanks Ledermann for his response to his previous letter, stating how neat his proofs are and discussing them at length. He refers to a paper of Aitken's published in the Edinburgh Mathematics Society, series 2, vol. 4, part II, and explores how the formula therein can assist them. The letter is unsigned, so appears to be incomplete.", "In the first letter, dated 6 Sept 1938 and numbered 37 (38), Thomson informs Ledermann of his plans for the next few weeks, which include going to London and to a Carnegie conference in Dinard.

He refers to a geometrical discussion of Bartlett's form of estimation which he originally sent with the letter for Ledermann's comments. This has not survived in the collection."}
bioghist
{'Ledermann leaving for St Andrews meant an early termination of his research by one term, which affected his being able to submit the DSc to Edinburgh.', "Walter Ledermann was born on 18 Mar 1911, the second of William and Charlotte Ledermann's four children, in Berlin, Germany. His Father was a physician, though the family was accustomed to poverty following World War I and the depression of the 1920s. Ledermann was a promising student from an early age, and a keen violinist. He received his leaving certificate from the Leibniz Gymnasium early due to his performance in classics and mathematics, which allowed him to complete his degree in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Berlin. There he encountered several mathematicians and physicists of note who inspired him, including Issai Schur, Heinz Hopf, Max Plank, and Erwin Shrodinger. On completion of his degree, it became clear to Ledermann that he could no longer stay in Germany. He won a scholarship created by students at St Andrews to support a Jewish refugee, during which time his brother was working in Edinburgh to gain a medical qualification. Ledermann was awarded his PhD after two years. Encouraged by Professor Turnbull of St Andrews University, Ledermann sought an interview with Professor Edmund Whittaker (later Sir) at the University of Edinburgh with a view to seeking employment there. Whittaker invited him to come as a visiting student to Edinburgh for one term, offering him a bursary of £50 and encouraging him to attend the lectures of A C Aitken. Aitken quickly became a friend to Ledermann, and introduced him to Godfrey Thomson, Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and Director of Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). At that time, Thomson required a mathematical assistant for a Carnegie funded project which would eventually result in the publication of his seminal book, The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, and he immediately offered Ledermann the post. It is from this period that the majority of Ledermann's papers, which largely comprise of letters from Thomson, were created. Ledermann's work with Thomson was interrupted for 6 months in 1937 when Ledermann accepted a post teaching at the University of Dundee. He returned to work with Thomson in Edinburgh until 1938, when he took a lecturer's post in the University of St Andrews. In 1940, Ledermann's naturalization was completed, and he was also awarded his DSc from the University of Edinburgh. He married his wife, Ruth Ledermann, a social worker, in 1946, later having a son, Jonathon. The couple moved to Manchester, where Ledermann was worked as a lecturer in pure mathematics in the University of Manchester, from 1946-1962. In 1962 Ledermann gained a lecture post at the new University of Sussex, where he eventually became a professor. He found the atmosphere of the modern university highly stimulating, and taught for two further years past the statutory age of retirement (then 65). Even after his official retirement in 1978, Ledermann continued to give occasional courses and revision classes to his students until 1997, when he and Ruth, by then a psychotherapist, moved to London. Ledermann died in London on 22 May 2009."}

{'Kenneth Murchison ( 1751-1796) was the father of Sir Roderick Impey Murchison. He served as a surgeon in Calcutta from 1772 before returning to Europe in 1784. After travelling for a short time he finally settled back in Scotland, purchasing the estate of Tarradale, Ross-shire in 1788. His wife was Barbara Mackenzie, who he married in 1790. He died when Sir Roderick Impey Murchison was still a child.', "Sir Roderick Impey Murchison succeeded to his father's estate of Tarradale. His mother remarried Colonel Robert Murray McGregor (died 1831) in 1798, who had property at Hurworth, Co Durham.", 'Sir Roderick Impey Murchison was admitted as a freeman to the Worshipful Company of Merchant Tailors of the City of London in 1869.', 'Kenneth Murchison (1751-1796) purchased the estate of Tarradale, Ross and Cromarty, shortl;y after his return to Scotland from India, where he had served as a surgeon at Calcutta. He married Barbara Mackenzie in 1790. Their son Roderick (later Sir) was born in 1792. Kenneth died when his son was still an infant. Roderick married Charlotte Hougin', 'Sir Roderick Impey Murchison ( 1792-1871), developed the modern classification of the Palaeozoic period, through his research emphasising biostratigraphy; the deposition of strata indicated by fossils. In the course of his career he successively defined the Silurian, Devonian and Permian strata, which replaced Greywacke and Coal Measures in the scientific literature. After serving with the army in the Peninsula War and a period of time pursuing his interest in hunting, the independently wealthy Murchison began attending lectures at the Royal Institution. In 1825 he joined the Geological Society of London. Shortly afterwards he read the society his first paper, on the geology of parts of Sussex, Hampshire and Surrey. In the following five years Murchison made field explorations to Scotland, France, and the Alps with either Adam Sedgwick or Charles Lyell. In 1831 he began a study of the Early Palaeozoic rocks in South Wales. These studies were the basis of his defining work The Silurian System, ( 1839) . Further geological research in south western England and the Rhineland, in collaboration with Adam Sedgwick, defined the Devonian System. Russian field expeditions, in conjunction with French colleagues, became the basis for the definition of the Permian System. These expeditions also resulted in his works The Geology of Russia in Europe, ( 1845) and The Ural Mountains, ( 1845) . Successive editions of his expanded treatise on the Silurian System, Siluria, ( 1854) (5th ed. 1872) were also prepared. Latterly he became interested in encouraging geographical exploration and colonialism. Murchison was president of the Geological Society of London in both 1831-1832 and 1842-1843 and became long term president of the Royal Geographical Society in 1844. As one of the founders of the British Association he was elected president for 1846. He was knighted in 1846 and also awarded the Russian Order of St. Stanislaus of the 1st Class. Appointments as director general of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and director of the Government School of Mines and the Museum of Economic Geology, London, followed in 1855. From 1863-1871 he was Patron of the Edinburgh Geological Society during which time he was raised to a Baronet. In 1871 he founded a Chair of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh.'}

{"John Robison (1739-1805) was Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh from 1774-1805. He lectured on a broad range of scientific subjects including mechanics, hydrodynamics, astronomy, optics, electricity and magnetism, introducing a good deal of mathematical demonstration. As well as lecturing on natural philosophy he was involved in several other activities. His writings were varied and influential. From 1793 -1801 Robison contributed well over forty articles to the third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, (1797) and its supplement, including: Resistance of Fluids, Roof, Running of Rivers, Seamanship, Telescope and Water-works, which are all full of practical information. In 1803 he produced Joseph Black's (1728-1799) carefully edited Lectures on Chemistry, (1803), and the following year he brought out his own Elements of Mechanical Philosophy, (1804), of which, however, only the first volume, on Dynamics and Astronomy, was completed. Robison's most widely read work was a strongly anti-Jacobean tract which set out to prove that the fraternity of 'Freemasons and Illuminati' was concerned in a plot to overthrow religion and government throughout the world. John Robison was born in 1739 in Boghall, Stirlingshire. He graduated with an MA from the University of Glasgow in 1756. Over the next few years he travelled extensively and took charge of John Harrison's (1693-1776) chronometer on its trial voyage to Jamaica in 1760-1761. The following year he returned to Glasgow and made the acquaintance of Joseph Black and James Watt (1736-1819), and in 1766 he succeeded Black as Lecturer in Chemistry at Glasgow. In 1770 he went out to Russia as private secretary to Admiral Knowles, who had been employed by the Empress of Russia to reorganise her fleet. Following on from this Robison was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Cronstadt in 1772. After two years he abandoned the position in order to take up the Chair of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh. During the time he held the post he also acted as a technical consultant to government departments and private industry. In 1783 Robison became the First General Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was a founder member of the Royal Society, and acted as its first General Secretary from 1783-1798. In 1798 Robison was made an Honorary LLD, College of New Jersey (now Princetown University)."}

{'The Wernerian Natural History Society was formed in January 1808 by nine scientists and laymen, presided over by Robert Jameson (1774-1854), and in honour of the illustrious Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750-1817) of Freiberg. Werner was a German geologist and mineralogist who helped to establish geology and mineralogy as two distinct sciences and became the first scientist to classify minerals systematically. His historical importance is now held to derive from his highly influential suggestion that the chronological order of deposition of the different rocks ought to be established. Writing at a time when chemists believed crystalline substances could only be deposited from solution, he assumed that all rocks were either sediments originally deposited at the bottom of the sea or were crystallized deposits precipitated from sea water. This school of geological thought emphasizing water as the chief agent in rock formation came to be known as Neptunism, as opposed to the Vulcanist school of which James Hutton (1726-1797) was a leading proponent. Neptunism was discredited when it was shown that crystalline rocks could be, and mostly were, formed when rocks hardened out of a molten state. The Wernerian Natural History Society was formed ostensibly for the purpose of promoting the study of the Sciences and of Natural History in particular. It attracted many members and remained in existence for almost 50 years, with Jameson remaining its president until his death in 1854. Between 1811 and 1839 eight volumes of memoirs were published, to which Jameson contributed more than a dozen papers on geological and mineralogical topics, as well as a few on zoology and botany. After 1839 proceedings were published in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal which Jameson edited.', 'The Minutes of the Wenerian Natural History Society, founded by Robert Jameson in 1808, show that it met on a monthly basis. A break usually took place between May and October, although occassional summer meetings were organised. Each year of meetings was termed a session, and a total of 44 of these took place before the society was wound up 1858. Meetings became less frequent in the final years of the society, with a complete break from November 1850-March 1856. During this period, Jameson, who was also the president, had died. It did not seem possible for the Society to continue without its mentor, and the final 2 years were devoted to disbanding the membership and settling affairs. The Society\'s constitution was laid down in the second meeting on 20 January 1808. This included regulations for members, office-bearers, meetings, visitors, subscriptions and transactions. In addition a Charter for the Society was gained from the Town Council of Edinburgh. Initially the Society had 4 categories of membership: honorary, resident, non-resident and foreign. The category "corresponding" was added in 1824. New membership applications were brisk in the first 15 years of the society, so that by 1823 there were approximately 500 members, although only around 130 of these were resident. After this new memberships slowed. Nominations for these were accepted at the monthly meeting and ratified at the following meeting. Other business affairs, such as the nomination of office-bearers, were also conducted at the monthly meetings. However, the main focus of meetings were the papers concerning all aspects of natural history which were read by members and guests of the society. Until 1823 these tended to concentrate on the earth sciences: geology, minerology and meteorology. Later the emphasis shifted to the pure sciences and life sciences: chemistry, physics, botany, zoology and entomology. Most of the scientists who gave papers consented to having their work published in the Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History Society or, after 1839 in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal . This consent was minuted.'}

{'John Walker (1731-1803) had a major impact on the establishment of geology as an organised classroom subject in an institution of higher education, and he therefore has a legitimate claim to the title of "Father of Geological Education." One of his most significant works was his essay on peat, in which he made a complete analysis of the organic content and origin of the substance. In other papers he affirmed that petroleum occurred in rocks as a natural substance. His discussion of rock structures included accurate definitions of strike and dip as well as recognition of horizontal strata overlying tilted beds, a condition to which he referred as offlap. In 1779 John Walker was appointed to the chair of Natural History at Edinburgh, a post which he held until his death in 1803. His university lectures included discussions on agriculture\'s place in national improvement, and his public lectures on agriculture and the Scottish Highlands. John Walker studied at the University of Edinburgh, where he prepared for the ministry in the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. He was later licensed to preach in 1754 and soon met Henry Home, Lord Kames (1696-1782), who became his sponsor. Through this association Walker was commissioned to make an extensive study of the Hebrides in 1764, a trip that he would repeat on several occasions. From the time of his first ministry in 1758 until his appointment in 1779 to the chair of Natural History at Edinburgh, Walker spent all of his spare time studying botany and geology. He was greatly influenced by the works of Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (1722-1765), and especially by the contributions of Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778). As a student Walker was trained in Latin and Greek and also quickly developed an interest in minerals. Influenced by William Cullen (1710-1790), Walker became particularly drawn to chemistry and mineralogy. He realised that the classification of minerals had been neglected and therefore travelled throughout the British Isles, sometimes with Cullen, collecting minerals from mines and outcrops. Using his own personal collection as well as that at the University Museum, he had established an Elementa Mineralogiae by the 1750s, and this classification was later modified to include 323 genera. Among the most interesting minerals that he collected in the 1760s was strontianite, from the mines of Leadhills. Walker played an instrumental role in the establishment of the Natural History Society of Edinburgh and was appointed first secretary of the Physical Section in 1783. He was also heavily involved in the organisation of the Natural History Society of Edinburgh in 1782. He was a long-time member of the Highland Society of Scotland, and as a result of his great interest in agriculture, formed the Agriculture Society of Edinburgh in 1792. These groups gave him the opportunity to participate in scientific discussions and provided an outlet for the publication of some of his articles.'}

{"Albert E. G. Pilliner was born in Glasgow in 1909 but spent much of his childhood in Shrewsbury, where his father worked as an engineer. He was educated at the Priory Grammar School, Shrewsbury. Although he was accepted by Cambridge University, he was unsuccessful in receiving a scholarship and so went to Birmingham University where he studied Chemistry. On graduating, Pilliner went into teaching. During the Second World War, he was selected for work in a government research facility near Wrexham and there he used his statistical knowledge and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of explosives. It was at this period in his life that Pilliner met William Emmett, another statistician. After the war, he took up teaching again, teaching Chemistry and Physics, and continued to keep in touch with Emmett. It was possibly through this communication that Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson came to hear of Pilliner, because in 1949 he took up a post as lecturer at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). On Thomson's retiral in 1951 and subsequent death in 1955, Pilliner and his colleagues continued Thomson's work within what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit for Academic Assessment, University of Edinburgh - dubbed Room 70 during Thomson's time. Pilliner took over the running of Room 70 as well as lecturing to the Dip.Ed. and B.Ed. courses for a number of years. In 1961, after a successful research trip to Israel on behalf of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), Pilliner was invited to work for the NFER (National Foundation of Educational Research) which he turned down. By the 1970s however, most of his time was spent working as a consultant to the British Council, UNESCO, and other bodies, and he conducted research into the examination systems of many countries including Mauritius, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Albert E. G. Pilliner died in 2003.", "The hand-driven, keyboard-set, pinwheel calculator produced in Sweden between 1932 and 1939 was the first such type manufactured by the 'Facit' company.

There are also substantial numbers of Sang's drafts of letters (some marked 'Not Sent'), memoranda and notes. Also present are several copies of Sang's 'Memorandum on the affairs of the Genetics Laboratory of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation during the period July 1948 to September 1950'.

{"Sang was appointed Principal Scientific Officer on the staff of the Agricultural Research Council's Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation (ABGRO, later renamed ABRO) from 01 July 1948, under the directorship of R.G White but directly reporting to C.H. Waddington, Chief Geneticist.", "On 18 July 1950, Sang and several colleagues wrote a letter to C.H Waddington, outlining their concerns about perceived bias or favouritism in matters of staff promotions and various administrative malpractices within the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation. W.K Slater, secretary of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), met with those concerned, after which he requested Sang and his colleagues to apologise to Waddington for their lack of faith in his direction and to tear up the letter which they had written. Sang agreed to this. However, by September he had written to W.G Alexander of the ARC complaining of the 'malpractices, maladministration and misuse of public property which has occurred in the Genetics Laboratory' and requesting that an 'official, and quasi-judicial enquiry' be carried out. He subsequently composed a memorandum, dated 14 September 1950, addressed to the ARC detailing the entire situation and again requesting a judicial enquiry. The resulting ARC enquiry 'into certain administrative matters connected with the Genetics Laboratory', took place in St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, from 11-13 October 1950 and was chaired by Slater. The outcome of the enquiry was that the Genetics Laboratory was 'reorganised', with Sang moving to a laboratory within the Poultry Research Centre under the directorship of Alan Greenwood. Waddington ceased to be employed by the ARC but instead became a full-time employee of the University, maintaining a dual position as Buchanan Professor and director of the Department of Animal Genetics."}

{"The mineralogist Robert Jameson was born in Leith on 11 July 1774. His early education was received in Leith and then he became the apprentice of a surgeon in Leith, with the aim of going to sea. He also attended classes at Edinburgh University, studying medicine, botany, chemistry, and natural history. By 1793, and influenced by the Professor of Natural History, John Walker (1731-1803), he abandoned medicine and the idea of being a ship's surgeon, and focused instead on science, particularly geology and mineralogy. Jameson was given the responsibility of looking after the University's museum. In 1793, he went to London, meeting naturalists and visiting museums to take notes. A visit to the Shetland Islands followed in 1794, to explore the geology, mineralogy, zoology and botany there. This led to the publication of The mineralogy of the Shetland Islands and of Arran, with an appendix containing observations on peat, kelp, and coal (1798). Earlier, in 1796, Jameson read two papers rejecting the vulcanist interpretation of the formation of Earth that had been put forward by Edinburgh geologist James Hutton (1726-1797). Hutton had propounded the theory that the features of the Earth's crust were caused by natural processes over geologic time; the principle of uniformitarianism. Instead, Jameson supported the ideas of Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750-1817) who had proclaimed the aqueous origin of rocks; that rocks were formed when immense quantities of minerals precipitated out of the waters of the biblical flood.Other visits to the Scottish islands in the north and west, and to Ireland, produced the two volume Mineralogy of the Scottish isles (1800) which was a fuller description of his views. In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in Freiburg, Saxony, to study under Werner. He returned to Edinburgh in 1802. On the death of Walker in 1803, Jameson was appointed Regius Professor of Natural History and Keeper of the University Museum. Over his fifty year tenure, he built up a huge collection of mineralogical and geological specimens for the Museum, including fossils, birds and insects. Although he had been one of the great exponents of Werner's geological tenets and founded the Wernerian Natural History Society in 1808, Jameson afterwards admitted conversion to the views of Hutton. He died in Edinburgh on 19 April 1854. Shortly after his death, the University Museum was transferred to the Crown and became part of the Royal Scottish Museum (now Royal Museum) in Edinburgh's Chambers Street."}

{"In 1887 Robert William Philip founded the Victoria Dispensary for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, the first of its kind in the world. The Royal Victoria Hospital was founded in 1894, and Polton Farm Colony in 1910. Together with the Dispensary these formed the nucleus of the 'Edinburgh Scheme' for combating tuberculosis. In 1914, the Dispensary, Hospital and Farm Colony were given to the City of Edinburgh and the Royal Victoria Tuberculosis Trust was founded. These came under the management of the Royal Victoria and Associated Hospitals NHS Trust in 1948, and the North Lothian District of Lothian Health Board in 1974. The Royal Victoria Hospital is currently within Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust."}

{"Mrs Elizabeth Cleghorn, the daughter of Lord Cockburn and widow of the Sheriff of Argyll, began in 1874 to help destitute patients in the medical wards of the Royal Infirmary. She visited wards, distributing clothing and sometimes money. When she appealed to her friends for help, the response was so great that, in 1879, a formal organisation was created: the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Samaritan Society. The original aim was to assist patients and their dependants with clothes and money and if the patient were the bread-winner, to help him find employment. Gradually the work was expanded to encompass all the Edinburgh hospitals. Almoners were appointed to identify patients in need, visit their homes and provide help and guidance. From 1923 the Infirmary appointed its own almoners, who worked in parallel with those of the Samaritan Society. In 1948 the Society's almoners were transferred to the Infirmary's social service staff. Even after the National Health Service came into being the Samaritans continued to work as a voluntary organisation. Their Committee of Management meets regularly with the Hospital's social work staff, in consultation with whom they make grants to tide patients and their families over until official help is given. Sometimes help is also provided in ways not covered by statutory rules and regulations. For a more comprehensive history of the Society see The Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Samaritan Society, 1879-1979 (GD2/9/2)."}

{"A pathologist was first appointed by the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1839 some years after the founding of the University Chair in 1831. The Infirmary housed its laboratories beside the mortuary at the West Gate while the University laboratory was located in the medical building at Teviot Place. The conditions under which post mortems took place were strictly governed. The consent of family or friends of the deceased was necessary before a post-mortem was carried out under the direction of the doctor who attended the case. For unclaimed bodies, written permission had to be given by at least one of the Medical Managers in response to a request from the doctor explaining why a post-mortem was necessary. According to the Rules and Regulations of the RIE in 1905, the pathologist was required to keep a 'Register of Dissections'in which was recorded a '...full indexed account of the naked eye and, where necessary, of the microscopic appearances after death in each case examined', as well as giving an abstract of the case history. The pathologist was also required to undertake histological and bacteriological examinations of material from RIE patients which were entered in a separate register. These registers were submitted to the Managers of the RIE on a weekly basis and form part of the collection listed below. In 1930 it was decided that the Professor of Pathology at Edinburgh University should also be made Honorary Pathologist to the hospital and have overall responsibility for the service. A Senior Pathologist was appointed to look after the laboratories in the RIE. The Municipal Hospitals originated in the former poor law hospitals at Craigleith, Pilton and Seafield and were renamed the Western General, Northern General and Eastern General in 1932. The University provided medical staff who were responsible for the treatment of the patients while the Corporation administered the service under the Medical Officer of Health. The Pathology Department of the University had been planned to accommodate a large volume of material and from 1936 it agreed to undertake all pathological work from the Municipal Hospitals. With the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948, the municipal hospitals ceased to be administered by the Corporation and came under the control of the South Eastern Regional Hospital Board. Arrangements were made with the Board to continue the laboratory service for the Northern Hospitals Group which included bacteriology and biochemistry as well as pathology. Additional staff and accommodation at the Western were made available. Support to the service was provided by the central lab. From 1941 the University agreed to undertake pathological work from the Emergency Hospitals which were established during WW1 in order to provide enough beds for war-time casualties (including Bangour Village, Gogarburn, Peel and Larbert Hospitals). This service offering routine, pathological examinations continued and was extended after the war to cover other hospitals in the Edinburgh area (and sometimes beyond) until c. 1958. Due to the increasing volume of work undertaken by the Department of Pathology, it was recommended in 1957 that routine pathological services for hospitals outwith the City of Edinburgh should cease. It was hoped that ultimately all routine pathological work would be restricted to the RIE. Bangour continued, however, to send biopsies to the University while pathologists travelled to the hospital to perform autopsy examinations until 1963 when a pathology service was finally established there. In 1965, the two pathology departments were brought together in new laboratories in the University Medical School. It was decided that all histo-pathology from the RIE would be sent to the University Medical School until the new RIE had been built. This meant that although the RIE continued to perform autopsies in the hospital, biopsy material and frozen sections were sent to the University for examination. The RIE neuropathology laboratory was tranferred to the Western in the early 1970s."}

In 1925 the surplus funds of the Scottish Women's Hospitals set up by Inglis was used to provide a memorial to her work. The Elsie Inglis opened in 1925. With the coming of the NHS, the hospitals became part of the Edinburgh Southern Hospitals under the South Eastern Regional Hospital Board. Bruntsfield Hospital closed in 1989. Elsie Inglis became part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Associated Hospitals Unit in 1984 and closed in 1988."}

{'In late 1983 instructions were issued to abolish the district level of management in the Scottish National Health Service. Following on from the recommendations of the Griffiths Report, unit-based management was introduced. Unit general managers were appointed who, in turn, reported to general managers at board level. These changes were adopted at the hospital, which, following the abolition of South Lothian District of Lothian Health Board, became the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Associated Hospitals Unit. Staff and committee titles and functions were gradually transformed during the 1980s. The unit structure remained in place until the formation of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS Trust in 1994. Over this period the other hospitals included in the Unit at various times were Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion, Elsie Inglis Memorial Maternity Hospital, Chalmers Hospital, Edinburgh Dental Hospital, City Hospital, Princess Margaret Rose Orthopaedic Hospital and Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion.'}

This began in 1930 with 26 donors, rapidly growing to 350 by 1936. In the same year the connection with the Crusaders ceased and the Edinburgh Blood Transfusion Service was founded.

{"The General Board of Commissioners in Lunacy was set up in 1867 to deal with the problem of pauper lunatics, who were either housed in overcrowded poorhouses or locked up and ignored by relatives. Before 1872 lunatics in the Borders were treated at Milholme House in Musselburgh, but the 1857 Lunacy (Scotland) Act provided for a new asylum to be built at Melrose to treat patients from the counties of Roxburgh, Berwick and Selkirk. 124 patients were admitted when the new 200-bed asylum opened in May 1872, but overcrowding soon became a problem. This was partly relieved by accommodating some female patients in specially constructed houses near the main hospital, one of the many innovative methods of care employed at the asylum. From early on patients were discharged after a probationary period, and the second Medical Superintendent Dr J. Carlyle Johnstone introduced parole for patients and the removal of locks from some interior doors. In 1899 a new female hospital was built which would later become Glentress and Traquair Wards, with new recreational and dining facilities and staff accommodation following soon after. A new male hospital opened in 1905, by which time it was necessary to build more new accommodation for females. By 1908 there were 440 beds available, and the Commissioner in Lunacy from Edinburgh commented that 'the general health of the patients seemed to be good'. In 1931 as a result of the Local Government (Scotland) Act of 1929 the Roxburgh District Board of Control was disbanded, and Roxburgh, Berwick and Selkirk County Councils took over the management of the asylum under the Roxburgh District Mental Hospital Joint Committee. With the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 the hospital came under the South Eastern Regional Hospital Board and was managed by Dingleton Mental Hospital Board of Management; at this point the name of Dingleton Hospital came to be commonly used. At this time the then Medical Superintendent Dr George MacDonald Bell introduced his 'open door'policy of removing locks from all ward doors to give patients the feeling of increased freedom. He also believed that the surrounding community should be involved as much as possible in the life of the hospital. In the following decades social psychiatry, work therapy and community psychiatry developed more and more. After NHS reorganisation in 1974 Dingleton became part of Borders Health Board. The hospital closed in 2001."}

Seven members of ELMC were elected at this first meeting to make up part of the membership of the Executive Council, as instructed in the Act. In 1972 a new Act was passed creating a more unified health service in Scotland. This Act abolished Regional Hospital Boards and Executive Councils, replacing them with local health boards which were to carry out functions on behalf of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Thus Lothian Health Board was formed, and in 1974 a new Lothian Area Medical Committee (LAMC) was created, with a General Practitioners Sub-Committee (GPSC).

A range of local National Health Service, municipal and voluntary institutions and organisations rapidly became involved. These papers were collected by staff at the Edinburgh office of Save the Children Scotland.'}

{'Naturalist Alexander Emmanuel Rodolphe Agassiz was born in Neuchatel, Switzerland, in 1835, and he arrived in the USA in 1849 after his father, the Swiss naturalist and geologist Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz (1807-1873) accepted a Professorship of Zoology at Harvard University. The younger Agassiz studied at Harvard where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1855 and at the Lawrence Scientific School where he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Science in 1857. In 1859 Agassiz was an Assistant on the United States Coast Survey and then from 1860 until 1865 he was an Assistant in Zoology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard. Between 1866 and 1869 he developed the Calumet and Hecla Copper Mines, Lake Superior, of which he was also Superintendent. In 1875 Agassiz was a member of an expedition to South America which inspected the copper mines of Peru and Chile and which surveyed Lake Titicaca in Peru. That year too he became Curator and Director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard. In 1891 he was an Assistant on the US Fish Commission. Agassiz assisted Sir Wyville Thomson in the examination and classification of the collections from H.M.S. Challenger. He took part in explorations of the Florida Reef in 1876, 1882, and 1896, in dredging expeditions during the US Coast Survey, 1877-1880, and in explorations of the Bahamas in 1893 and of the Bermudas in 1894. He was involved in explorations of the coral reefs of the Fiji Islands in 1897, the Great Barrier Reef in 1898, and the Hawaiian Islands in 1899. There were deep sea explorations of the Panamic Region and Galapagos in 1891, an expedition to the Tropical Pacific in 1900 and to the Eastern Pacific in 1904-1905. In 1898, Agassiz became President of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Alexander Agassiz died on 29 March 1910.'}

{"The original Edinburgh Infirmary, Hospital for the Sick Poor, Physicians' Hospital, or Little House was located at the head of Robertson's Close, in Edinburgh. A town house was rented from the Town Council and patients were admitted to the four beds then available from 6 August 1729. In 1936 a Royal Charter was obtained under the name The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. A 228-bed purpose-built hospital designed by William Adam soon followed, and the first patients were admitted to it in 1741. It was located between what are now Infirmary Street and Drummond Street, Edinburgh. Two further surgical hospital buildings were added in 1832 and 1853. Due to overcrowding throughout this so-called High School Yards site, David Bryce was commissioned to design a new hospital and in 1879 the Infirmary moved to Lauriston Place, its main building conforming to the pavilion style of surgical and medial ward arrangement. Concern over the Lauriston site began to be expressed first in 1946, when it was felt that the current Royal Infirmary buildings were insufficient to meet the needs of the new National Health Service. Various plans were put forward, including demolition and rebuilding of the existing site, and construction of a brand new Royal Infirmary on a greenfield site, along with another new southern general hospital. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s a number of options were discussed, but the decision was eventually made to rebuild at Lauriston in a series of phases which aimed to minimise disruption to patients and staff. Work was repeatedly delayed however, due in part to financial issues and also to the fact that the Secretary of State for Scotland declared that the listed buildings could not be demolished, and it was not until 1981 that the first phase of rebuilding was completed. Again however this plan did not come to fruition, and in the late 1990s work was begun on a new Royal Infirmary at Little France which would also replace the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion, the Princess Margaret Rose Orthopaedic Hospital (PMR) and the City Hospital. Full completion occurred in 2003, although the first patients moved in in January 2002 as the PMR closed. Instrumental in the founding of the RIE in 1729 was the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, itself founded some 90 years earlier. In the seventeenth century, Edinburgh physicians had started holding meetings in their own homes to discuss medical practice and standards and their regulation and improvement. Sir Robert Sibbald, an eminent physician and noted historian, was a member of this group. Sibbald had the opportunity of petitioning King Charles II, who granted the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh its Royal Charter in 1681. Thus it is that Sir Robert is generally accepted to be the founder of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. The 'Baffin' was built to the design of William Scoresby (1789-1857). The ship was the first whaler to be built in Liverpool and was launched on 15th February 1820, having a successful first voyage and in 1822, Scoresby mapped the East coast of Greenland."}

{'The Angus Fraser Music Manuscript consists of three named collections intended for publication, a series of sets of variations mostly on well-known airs, and a variety of less-organised manuscript pages. The differing interests of Simon Fraser and Angus Fraser are reflected in the Manuscript.'}
bioghist
{'While this manuscript collection is known as The Angus Fraser Manuscript, the content is the work of two individuals, Simon Fraser of Knockie in the parish of Abertarff, born 1773, and Angus Fraser his son, born perhaps 1800 in Inverness. An illegitimate child, Angus used his father\'s surname from around the age of fourteen when he joined the army, in Edinburgh, in 1814. His military career lasted some 31 years, much of it served with the 1st Royal Scots from 1832. His highest rank was Colour Sergeant. Although he learned several tunes as a child, it was during the period with the Royal Scots that he became interested in music and acquired his theoretical knowledge. He discharged from the army, with a pension, in 1845, and returned to Inverness living at the family home at 25 Rose Street. The father, Captain Simon Fraser, died in Inverness in 1852, while Angus Fraser died on 4 February 1870. The collection of music was probably begun during Angus Fraser\'s army career, but it was in retirement that the manuscript reached its final form. Because of the inheritance of musical and literary material from the elder Fraser, some of the airs in the Angus Fraser Manuscript are dated as early as 1820. The notes to the manuscript collection were written in 1858. Although some Highland airs were published,Knockie(1874), the history of the collection is obscure until "rediscovery" by a member of Edinburgh University Library staff in an Edinburgh bookshop in the 1950s. It was presented to the Library.'}

{"The Scottish Students' Song Book Committee was set up in December 1889 with the aim of producing a collection of songs for use by students. The lack of such a collection had long been felt in Scotland. In the mid-1880s a committee had been set up in St. Andrews to collect and publish the songs popular among the students there. This had met with difficulties however, and instead it was agreed to abandon the scheme and to prepare an Inter-University Song Book under the auspices of the then four Scottish Students' Representative Councils. With the less than enthusiastic support of the four SSRCs, the Scottish Students' Song Book Committee set about its task under the editorial convenership of Dr. Millar Patrick.The Scottish Students' Song Bookwent on sale in March 1891 and was an immediate success, selling out in three weeks. Later editions appeared in 1892 and 1897. The great success of the book made it necessary to form a limited company in 1891 - the Scottish Students' Song Book Committee Ltd. - which had throughout the 20th century produced several editions of theSong Bookand its companionThe British Students' Song Book(1912). Since 1891, some 400,000 copies had been sold."}

In 1950 he became Registrar at Edinburgh Academy, retiring in 1976. Prior to his retiral he had been toying with the idea of compiling a history of the defence of the coast of Scotland from early times. He set about building up a mass of Public Record Office references from the Admiralty, the Committee for Imperial Defence, and the War Office, and he had sounded out various ex-Forth Coast Gunners and other likely sources for inputs towards the project.

{'George Ballingall, who was Regius Professor of Military Surgery at the University of Edinburgh, was born on 2 May 1780 in Forglen, Banffshire, where his father was a minister. He attended four literary sessions at the University of St. Andrews before following a course of medical study at the University of Edinburgh between 1803 and 1806, and received his diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, on 17 December 1805. Ballingall was then appointed as Assistant Surgeon to the 2nd Battalion 1st Royals. He served in India, witnessed the capture of Java in 1811, and was in occupied Paris in 1815. In November 1815 he was appointed Surgeon to the 33rd Regiment of Foot, retiring in 1818. He had also re-matriculated in 1816 to study Chemistry and Military Surgery, and formally graduated in 1819. His M.D. thesisDe Apoplexia Sanguineawas completed at the University that year. In 1823, Ballingall became Lecturer on Military Surgery at the University, and in 1825 he succeeded to the Chair of Military Surgery. During his period of tenure Ballingall fervently sought to impress upon the political authorities of the day the necessity of teaching Military Surgery as a separate discipline, and to establish similar chairs or lectureships in London and Dublin. He also took a keen interest in the running of the Army Medical Department, particularly during the disastrous years of the Crimean War. Most notable amongst his published works arePractical observations on fever, dysentery, and liver complaints, as they occur amongst the European troops in India: to which is annexed, an essay on syphilis(1823),The life of Dr. Barclay(circa 1827),Outlines of military surgery, first published asOutlines of the course of lectures on military surgery(1833), andObservations on the site and construction of hospitals(1851).

The founder was George Fox (1624-1691), a shoemaker from Nottingham, who began giving sermons in 1643 and formed a group called the Friends of Truth, later becoming known as the Society of Friends. After 1656, the Friends refused to attend Anglican services and stopped paying their tithes. Fox was arrested and a judge told him that he should 'quake in the presence of the Lord'. After this the Friends became known as Quakers. The Friends believe in the immediacy of Christ's teaching and guidance, the consequent irrelevance of consecrated buildings and an ordained ministry, and the application of Christ's teaching to the whole of life. However, in the seventeenth century these beliefs met with persecution, and during the reign of Charles II over 13,000 were arrested and imprisoned and some were transported. Even so, the group grew rapidly particularly in the north of England and by 1660, Fox had made some 20,000 converts and missionaries were at work in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Persecution continued throughout the seventeenth century and many emigrated to North America. In 1681 William Penn founded the American Quaker Colony of Pennsylvania, and in 1683 Francis Daniel Pastorius from Germany established the Quaker settlement of Germantown. During the eighteenth the Friends went through a series of separations and schisms - some advocating Quietism, some following the theology of John Wesley, some following the teaching of Elias Hicks. The Friends involved themselves in politics and social reform and became the first religious group to denounce slavery century. In 1783, they presented the first substantial anti-slavery petition to Parliament. Also in Britain, Elizabeth Fry joined the prison reform movement and Joseph Lancaster worked for improvements in education. The Peace Society was also formed in a campaign to end war. By the beginning of the nineteenth century there were around 25,000 Quakers in Britain and many proved themselves to be entrepreneurial. Under Edward Pease a group helped to form the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, and companies formed by Quakers included Cadbury, Fry, Rowntree, Huntly and Palmer, Bryant and May, Barclays, and Lloyds."}

{"Action by French and British legions took place in Spain in the 1830s during the First Carlist War, 1833-1839. The background to the War had been the death of King Ferdinand VII of Spain and the subsequent Regency of Queen Cristina - his fourth wife - on behalf of their infant daughter Isabel II. Spain had become split into two factions known as the Cristinos, or Isabelinos, and the Carlists. Cristinos were the supporters of the Queen-Regent and the government, and the Carlists were supporters of Don Carlos (Carlos Maria Isidro de Borbon, 1788-1855) a Pretender to the Spanish throne and brother of Ferdinand VII. Carlists had invoked the Salic Law which had been introduced to Spain by King Philip V in 1713. Salic Law excluded females from royal succession. There had been more to the conflict than this however. Roots lay in the 1820s with the growth of an extreme political party which materialised into the paramilitary Royalist Volunteers (Realistas Volunarios) in 1827. Opposed to liberalism in Spain, this traditionalist group regarded Don Carlos as its figurehead. The disputed succession and the ideological current provoked the First Carlist War which centred around the Carlist homelands of the Basque Country and Aragon, although fighting also covered the rest of Spain at one time or another. Defeated in the First Carlist War, the Carlists waged a Second War in the 1840s, a coup was attempted in 1860 in support of the Don Carlos heir, and a Third War was underway between 1872 and 1876. There was also an outbreak of insurgency in support of the Carlist claim in 1900-1902. In 1918 the formation of the Traditionalist Party became the principal voice of Carlism but it was merged with the Falange in 1937 by General Francisco Franco, although neither groups had much in common. The Carlist line had become extinct in 1936 with the death of Don Alfonso Carlos, duque de San Jaime, though Francis Xavier of Bourbon-Parma (styled as Charles IX) was nominated as 'successor' and he in turn was succeeded by his son Carlos-Hugo, Duke of Parma. The present King of Spain, Juan Carlos, was the son of Don Juan, conde de Barcelona, and grandson of King Alfonso XIII."}

{"The writer Frederick Burrows Urquhart was born on 12 July 1912 in Edinburgh. Although he wrote a number of novels, Fred Urquhart's strength was the short story in which his characters did the talking. He had an ear for all forms of accent and dialect and took ungrammatical yet creative liberties with the language. Although he spent many years in southern England after the war, his creative impulses were rooted in Lowland Scotland: on the Firth of Forth and Clydeside; in coastal Wigtownshire where he was at school for a while; and on Tayside, where he also spent some of his childhood . His stories generally dealt with the lives of ordinary people, and the cruelty and violence of such lives was a constant theme. He was particularly sensitive to the violence dealt out to women, and his homosexuality probably enabled him to portray the female psyche with insight and tenderness. The ugliness of war (he was a pacifist) was an extension of these concerns. The son of a chauffeur, Urquhart was educated at Stranraer High School and Broughton Secondary School. On leaving school at the age of fifteen he worked for some years in a bookshop in Edinburgh. At the same time he began to write, and from the early 1930s onwards had stories published in periodicals as well as broadcast on the radio. He left the bookshop in 1935 to concentrate on writing. His first published novel wasTime Will Knit(1938), the story of working-class Edinburgh life. When war came in 1939 Urquhart, as a declared conscientious objector, was sent to work on the land. It was at this point that his first collection of short stories appeared,I fell for a Sailor(1940). In 1944 Urquhart was working in England at Woburn Abbey, the estate of the Duke of Bedford, which made a good base for contacting artistic and literary circles in London. He soon met the Scottish painters Robert Colquhoun and Robert MacBryde who had moved to London from Glasgow themselves only a year or two before, and he also got to know George Orwell and Rhys Davies. In these early post-war years came his second collection of stories,The Clouds are Big with Mercy(1946). From 1947 Urquhart worked as a reader for a London literary agency and from 1951-54 was a script-reader for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Further volumes of short stories appeared, among themThe Last GI Bride Wore Tartan(1947) andThe Year of the Short Corn and Other Stories(1949). Two more novels appeared ,The Ferret was Abraham's Daughter(1949) andJezebel's Dust(1951). With a decline in interest for the serious short story, Urquhart took on a number of editing tasks, and was also a reader for Cassell & Co. Ltd., 1951-74, the London scout for Walt Disney Productions, 1959-60, and a reader for J.M. Dent & Sons Ltd., 1967-71. He kept on writing too, and there was a final novel,Palace of Green Days(1979), which drew upon childhood memories of Perthshire, where his father was chauffeur to the Earl of Breadalbane at Taymouth Castle. There appeared further collections of short stories, notablyA Diver in China Seas(1980), which was impressive for its insight into its women characters. With his companion, the dancer Peter Wyndham Allen, Urquhart had moved into a house in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex in 1958, but when Wyndham Allen died in 1990 Urquhart moved back to Scotland and settled in Musselburgh. He died in Edinburgh on 2 December 1995."}

{"Sierra Leone in West Africa became an independent nation on 27 April 1961. The country has substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources, with minerals as diverse as diamonds, titanium ore, bauxite, iron ore, gold, and chromite. Diamonds, discovered in the eastern Kono District in 1930, had become the largest export earner for the country by 1938. The diamond Kono deposits are alluvial and so heavy equipment isn't necessary, and indeed manual digging can extract the material. Although mining authorities had been able to control the mines, a diamond rush in the 1950s brought an influx of illegal diggers into the area. Between 1953 and 1957 the number of illegals had grown from 5,000 to as many as 70,000. In spite of the presence of a paramilitary force with helicopter support, crime and violence became a characteristic of the Kono district. Diamonds were smuggled to Liberia where higher profits were to be made."}
