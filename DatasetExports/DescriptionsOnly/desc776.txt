'Between 1943 and 1945, Thompson set about keeping a personal wartime journal hoping to register possible changes to his psychological make-up. The journal offers data on the effects of long-term overseas service amongst officers. The journal is in diary form with 9 volumes, covering the period 18 July 1943 to 15 October 1945, and written while in North Africa, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Greece, and Austria. Within the diaries are newspaper cuttings of the period, photographs, franked envelopes, and other inserted materials. The collection also includes printed matter in the form of New Zealand Law Reports (1962, 1963), New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, press-cuttings relating to Thompson v. Turbott (1961-1965), and material relating to a Public Service Appeal.'


'A. W. S. Thompson graduated with the degree of M.B. in 1933. During the Second World War, Thompson was sent overseas to North Africa and Italy and the Middle East from 1943 onwards with, principally, the Royal Army Medical Corps and the 8th Army. He served as a hygiene officer with the Field Hygiene Section and Mobile Hygiene Section, and was a Major then Lieutenant-Colonel. Latterly, in the late-1960s, Dr. Thompson was Director, Division of Clinical Services, at the Department of Health in Wellington, New Zealand. In the late-1970s, he was living in Dorset, England.'
