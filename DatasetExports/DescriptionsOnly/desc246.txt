"James Tait Black was born in 1826. He was a partner in the publishing house of A & C Black Ltd. The firm had been founded in 1807 by Adam and Charles Black in Edinburgh, and moved to the Soho district of London in 1889. In 1851, the firm bought the copyright of Walter Scott's Waverley Novels for Â£27,000. Black was the husband of Mrs Janet Coutts Black who set up a literature prize in his name in 1919 after his death in 1911. Today, the company is now part of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, who purchased it in 2000. They are publishers of a range of reference works."
