'George Low was born in Edzell, Angus, in 1747. He was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and then at St. Andrews University. In 1768, Low went to Stromness, Orkney, as a tutor. The rest of his life was taken up by the study of the natural history of the Orkney Islands, looking at birds, flora and fauna, and marine life there. As an aid to his studies of marine life, he constructed a microscope. In 1771, Low became licensed as a Minister by the Presbytery of Cairston, but he remained in Stromness for a couple more years after that. In the meantime, in 1772, after a visit to Iceland, the explorer and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820) visited Orkney in the company of the Swedish botanist Dr. Daniel Solander (1736-1782), and physician Dr. James Lind (1716-1794). Through them, Low was able to widen his correspondence and connections, and in 1774 began a tour of the south islands of Orkney and the whole of the Shetland Islands. Also in 1774, he was installed in the Parish of Birsay and Harray, and as Minister there, in relative seclusion, he was able to complete his works on the history and flora and fauna of Orkney. This was in addition to earlier work on the commerce, population, language, and archaeology of the islands. In 1778, Low toured the north islands of Orkney. Extensive use of the microscope during his research probably contributed to the onset of opthalmia and near complete blindness by 1793, thus cutting him off from his studies. George Low died in Orkney on 13 March 1795.'
