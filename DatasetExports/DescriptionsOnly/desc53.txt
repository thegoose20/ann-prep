'The collection is composed of: a black and white photograph - studio portrait - of Margaret Robertson wearing academic dress during the period of her graduation in 1919; copy of a studio portrait, seated pose, during the period of graduation; and, degree certificate or parchment of Margaret Robertson, interesting for the hand-corrected script indicating 1919 rather than 1909 (and indicative of the shortage of parchment paper in the wake of the 1914-1918 war).'


'Margaret Robertson was born in March 1895, the first of six children. She was educated at the village school in Balnaguard, north Perthshire, Tayside, in Scotland, and then at Breadalbane Academy in Aberfeldy and at Perth Academy. After secondary education, she studied at Edinburgh University and graduated in 1919. She was subsequently appointed as a teacher of English and French at Perth Academy. Margaret Robertson married Alexander Macgregor (M.A., Glasgow) and the couple had three children. They lived in Invergowrie, near Dundee, where Mr. Macgregor was the Headmaster of the local school, Invergowrie Public School. Their son James (Dr. James D. Macgregor) became a doctor and he served with the Colonial Medical Service in Sierra Leone and the Solomon Islands. Margaret Robertson (Mrs. Alexander Macgregor) died on 6 December 1987 in Hillside Hospital, Perth.'
