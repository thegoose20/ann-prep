"Including bibliography this bound illustrated volume has 293 pages. The thesis is concerned with 'one of the earliest known historical accounts of the Acadian Deportation', an account based 'on primary documents, eye-witness accounts and Acadian oral tradition'. It provides an annotated edition of the original edition of the manuscript."


"The study is concerned with 'one of the earliest known historical accounts of Acadian Deportation' which was written by the Rev. Dr. Andrew Brown in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Brown's manuscript was entitled Removal of the French inhabitants of Nova Scotia by Lieut. Governor Lawrence and His Majesty's Council in October 1755. The primary purpose of the study was to provide an annotated edition of the manuscript, but it also takes a broader look at Brown. The external thesis was written by Sara J. Beanlands of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was submitted to Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, in September 2010."
