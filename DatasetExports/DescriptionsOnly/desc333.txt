Topics discussed include: Accommodation; unemployment; neighbours.Acommodation: INTVEE and family are tenants in a cottage type house, previous tenants had been evicted and the house was in a shocking state despite the Corporation carrying out cleaning and repairs.Unemployment: During the interview INTVEE became upset about her husband's imprisonment for theft and subsequent inability to find work. She showed much anxiety about the neighbours talking about her or the children being bullied at school. She is ashamed that the family has been on Nationial Assistance for a number of years. Her husband spends most of his time at the boxing club. It took her a long time to agree to her children having free school dinners. She is angry at the National Assistance Board for telling her it was up to her to make her husband work.Until recently INVTEE had a part time cleaning job in a private household three times a week. She enjoyed this, it got her out of the house and away from the children. However she was worried that she might be breaking the law and the NAB would find out leading to another court case. Before getting married she had worked as a nursemaid from the age of 14. Her own mother died in childbirth when she was nine years old. She can't stand cheeky kids and is very firm with her children. She married to get away from home, her father had been disabled in the First World War, he had a good job but was hot-tempered. He had many rows with her husband about is unemployment but each time she left him, her father insisted she go back. She worries that anxiety about her situation contribued to her father's death.Neighbours: INTVEE has no neighbours she can talk to. Her husband is kind and considerate but lazy. Reference made to amount of borrowing that goes on between neighbours, many have hire purchase committments from trying to furnish five-roomed houses all at once and are now in debt.INTVEE takes yellow pills for depression but INTVER thinks they are not working and hopes that speaking about her feelings of guilt about her father might have helped.

They had previously lived in a six apartment basement flat in town but had to leave as the building was unsafe. Wife would like to leave this flat has it is too overcrowded but otherwise likes the district. She thinks the balcony would be more useful as part of the interior and just makes the rooms darker. INTVER agrees that the balconies on the ground floor serve no function other than an aesthetic one but aren\'t particularly beautiful. A main complaint is the lack of cupboard space and the coal cellar in the hall is full of trunks and boxes. There are hooks in the hall for coats but when the coats are there is no room to pass. The living room is a reasonable size but it has a large three piece suite sideboard, dining table and chairs, bookcase it is very cluttered. The older son sleeps in this room on a put-up settee. The kitchen is off the living room with fitted cupboards, a small table, new washing machine and a new electric cooker. INTVER comments that the house is "was quite middle class in its furnishing. There was a large unworn carpet in the sitting room, and the moquette suite was rather typically suburban, as was all the other veneered walnut furniture". The wife used to be against the Unions but is for them now that she realised they can increase her wage from that of an unskilled worker to semi-skilled worker. INTVER notes that he has heard from another researcher that the family fly to Spain every year and stay in Tossa del Mar. This is their big expense and they save all year. Male INTVEE occasionally goes to the Episcopal Church. They think the house is pretty quiet because of the layout, the only noise is the rubbish going down the chute which falls just outside their bedroom window. Female INTVEE is satisfied with the district and is quoted as saying "They\'re rather like us - they\'re all middle-class, I should say". She liked to watch the children playing outside but told them off if their ball came into her garden. She once kept the ball and said the child\'s father would have to come and get it, she was surprised when he did as in her day father\'s wouldn\'t get involved. She was not allowed to look at the house before taking it and was told "If you take the keys you take the house".INTVER\'s thoughts: Impressed with INTVEE\'s willingness to bring her neighbours up to her level of middle class and the lack of hostility towards them given she had previously lived in a large house with no neighbours.', "INTVER disappointed with the interview and thought it was repetitive. One INTVEE recalls how at one time you weren't allowed into Newhaven if you weren't from there, her father used to get doused with water if he tried to cross the bridge to court her mother. They didn't allow their people to go to Edinburgh if they thought they might marry Edinburgh folk but then they discovered they'd been marrying too much within and their children weren't quite right so they started to spread. The Newhaven people were always suspicious and they all had by-names because there were so many with the same surname e.g. Black Ritty, Braggie, Tiger. When she visited her aunt they were always knitting sweaters and underwear for the men but would still have a line of washing out and big families to look after. She thinks the opening of the dance halls contributed to the break up of the Newhaven community, the girls would meet men from Edinburgh. INTVEEs are critical of the younger generation - they have washing machines but are still tired, they use a mop to clean the stairs instead of getting down on hands and knees. Their husbands and sons don't do anything about the house - an attraction of the new houses is an extra room to keep the men from under their feet.", '"This child seems dull, never speaks, just sits and looks at you."Mother: 30.1 Siblings: 30.3', '"A gardener, queer but quiet."Relatives in survey: Sibling 33.41', "Discussion about the education of their son who started at St Mary's Cathedral School and then went to Daniel Stewart's for which he won a bursary.

She is pleased with it, would just like it to be rotated so she could have a view of the Pentlands. INTVER is surprised to see Hopes Reversible windows in the bathroom which are expensive and considered to be good class fittings. The windows pivot horizontally and were designed for multi-storey flats but the curtain rail obstructs the movement, she\'s discovered that her neighbours have a piece of wood fitted above the window on the lintel on which the curtains are suspended far forward enough to allow the window to rotate. It is a three roomed flat if the small box room is included as a room. INTVER thinks the layout is good and quality of fittings good but joinery is bad - doors don\'t fit well, some are too loose and some are too tight. INTVER\'s flat is on the top floor, all the outside doors are glazed in deep turquoise glass panels. There is a box room to the right and a bedroom and living room straight ahead. The living room has a dining recess, access to the balcony and kitchen which has a sink, cooker and some work tops. To the left of the front door is a corridor with cupboards leading to the bathroom with bath, WC and washbasin. The flooring throughout is Marley tile in a dark grey. There is soft grey on the walls with all the doors done in a dark turquoise colour. INTVER thinks it\'s the best colour scheme he has seen in any of the corporation flats, INTVEE doesn\'t like it, thinks it is too sombre. The colour schemes in the flats on the landing are done alternately -two have mustard yellow doors and the other two are turquoise. The heating is underfloor heating in the bedroom, living room and hall but not the bathroom or kitchen. There s a double bar electric fire in the living room. She can\'t get much heat out of the underfloor heating. She calls the dining recess a dinette and wants to carpet it but was advised not to buy wall to wall because of the underfloor heating. INTVER describes the furnishings as "conventional with a slight hint of contemporary about them...on the whole nothing much of great fascination but all of it with a solid middle class quality". She moved in on a Saturday which is supposed to be unlucky but she had no choice "Saturday flitting, short sitting". The corporation has given them a card which says "it\'s your turn to clean the stairs next week", once you have cleaned the stairs you put the card through your neighbour\'s door. She thinks Muirhouse has a reputation for being a tough district but she thinks there\'s a difference between the new multi storeys and the older part. She thinks Leith is declining, the docks have almost gone out of business and the people are moving away, she knows one man of 76yrs who remembers when the ships used to lie out in the Forth waiting for entry. She thinks Leith will stay dead until its rebuilt. She doesn\'t think people should go to bingo, she went when on holiday once and won a tray, a bread tin with a tip back lid, a pyrex casserole and some teacups and saucers which she was pleased with but she knows women who go and don\'t win anything.', '"Has a bad reputation, but now very respectable.

Her husband thinks the Doo\'cot pub is rowdy.House: INTVER describes the house as "very bare, the wallpaper dirty and torn, scanty and shabby furniture with bright pink lino from which the pattern has been largely rubbed off. There\'s an old TV and an old radio set". INTVEE complains of the lack of mod. cons. in particular the wash basin being over the bath in the bathroom.

She pays several shillings a week into a clothing club for the children. The rent is 23/1 and she needs a pound a day to feed the family which she often doesn\'t have. It is generally four pounds a week for rent, gas, coal and electricity. Harrington observes that she is the first women she has met who adhere to the old Scottish pattern of the wife getting the unopened pay packet and giving pocket money to her husband.Local amenities: INTVEE complains about the lack of shops and it is worth taking a bus trip to Leith where the shops are cheaper. She used the launderette by the Doo\'cot but since it closed she hires one of the washing machines that are brought round by vans.Education: INTVEE also complains about the lack of choice of Catholic schools. The family have an annual education endowment policy for each child to get something at fifteen which she hopes will buy tools for the boys and pay for comptometer operating or typing lessons for the girls.Leisure: INTVEE enjoys reading, mainly adventure stories - Rider Haggard, Zane Gray, Conan Doyle. Her love of reading came from her grandfather who would read her Walter Scott. On the television she enjoys watching wild life series.Child rearing: INTVEE likes the health visitors but would consult her mother before consulting them. She smacked her children and was happy for them to play in the street of the stair. Reference to her son\'s imminent circumcision operation.Religion: INTVEE converted to Catholicism on marriage. She has no regrets and find more positive satisfaction from Catholicism. Her image of Protestantism is formality, convention and snobbishness.

INTVER describes the rooms as small and poorly furnished but very clean even though the visit was not pre-arranged. INTVEE thinks the layout is inconvenient especially in the bathroom where there is no separate washbasin and the washbasin overhangs one end of the bath which makes bathing the children (done in pairs) awkward. Also the coal place is situated in the kitchen which means dust goes over food all the time. The doors are painted bright yellow, no peeling wallpaper. They replaced the black leaded grate with a tiled one when they moved in mainly because of the work involved in black-leading. The children are described by the INTVER as healthy, bonny, friendly and lively. INTVEE does not like the district - very rough, many drunks on Saturdays, fights and prevalence of police.

Other topics discussed include: The neighbourhood and social contacts; television, cars; money.INTVEE is described as rather aggressive but not unfriendly. He lives on the ground floor of a two storey block with his wife and two children aged 15 and 12. He has older children who no longer live at home. He\'d like to move if he could. His house is a four-apartment, he likes it but thinks the rent is too high at 26/3d. INTVER describes the house as dingy, it is decorated with contemporary style paper on the wall but the paintwork is battered and the floor coverings scruffy - dirty lino with a few worn out mats. INTVER thinks it doesn\'t look like a house in which a woman lives and wonders if INTVEE\'s wife doesn\'t have time to bother. There is a fairly new television in the living room and a radiogramme. INTVER also notes that "above the mantelpiece was an absolutely hideous combination of mirror and picture which I think must have come from Woolworth\'s, and on the opposite wall were two huge base-relief plates with pictures of mules on". INTVER likes the fireplace which is an old iron one. INTVEE has the fire on most of the time so he can get enough hot water, when asked about the smokeless zone, he says he\'d almost think of moving out of the Edinburgh before giving up his coal fire, coke and anthracite are no good. He would like to have a front door of his own and is fed up of the light on the stair breaking. He thinks the corporation should do more to make the estate look nice, they had been on at him for not digging his garden but due to a disability he is unable to do it himself. The corporation are letting garages nearby for £2 10s but there is a big waiting list. He wants to make a garage out of asbestos and put wheels on it so they can\'t charge him for it. He doesn\'t think it is a good neighbourhood, there\'s a lot of scrounging people, it\'s worse than it was when he moved in. He\'s the only person on the stair who has been there since the beginning. During the war he grew vegetables in the front garden but local children would come and steal them so he connected the fence to the mains electricity. There is nowhere for the children to go and the builders left stones and bricks so of course the children are going to throw them about. He likes his neighbours but doesn\'t socialise with them. He watches television every night, INTVER comments that he is not ashamed to admit this unlike some other interviewees. He listens to Housewifes Choice every morning on the wireless. He does not like the NAB [National Assistance Board] as they have been on at him and told him he shouldn\'t go to the pictures. INTVER notes that he is the first person to criticise the NAB. He thinks the corporation waste money and produce the worst services in the country, the roads are awful and the fences shoddy, they put in shoddy things that don\'t last. Edinburgh is a question of pride and poverty. He doesn\'t like the church - thinks it\'s too much like a dance hall and the roller blinds inside are an eyesore. He doesn\'t like the police, they asked friends of his to turn out their pockets and kicked one of them in the backside. If he had the money he\'d like to buy his own small detached house in the country. He thinks Thomas Gaffe who runs one of the mobile vans is doing really well, he has a shop in Longstone and runs three vans.Interviewer\'s thoughts: Doesn\'t think INTVWEE is particularly reliable, was unduly aggressive and concentrates on the worst in everything. During the interview he let the corporation men working on the fences use his kettle and warmed their pies for them so is not against everyone.', '"Manic depressive psychosis with recurrent mania.

She lives with her husband and 18 month old baby. The house has not long been completed and they are the first occupants. Their block houses twenty families in six flats over five floors; the upper flats are on two levels. INTVEE has no complaints about the house, INTVER thinks it is a very decent house as municipal building goes, "decently proportioned rooms, a well-fitted kitchen, little noise and no damp. It was even decorated with lilac painted doors and yellow walls everywhere except in the living -room which was mushroom". All decorating was done prior to INTVEE moving in. INTVEE likes to choose her food carefully and goes to shops at Davidsons Mains or Groathill. INTVER notes that she doesn\'t choose her furniture carefully as the leg falls off a recently bought coffee table during the interview. INTVER describes the interview as enjoyable and thinks the INTVEE had been looking forward to it. INTVEE\'s mother who is in her fifties is also present. INTVER was miserable when she first moved to the area from the centre of town, she thought everyone was unfriendly and stand offish. She wept quite a bit because of loneliness in the first few weeks. Now she is friendly with some of the women on her stair and will have a cup of tea with one of them. INTVWR notes that there does not seem to be "chain reaction" with people introducing each other. INTVEE\'s husband will take the baby out but has never bathed him or filled a bottle. The baby has always been bottle fed with national dried milk and was weaned at about 8 months. INTVEE\'s mother thinks babies are weaned too early now. INTVEE not impressed with the welfare clinic she attends, she thinks they rattle off stock answers and attribute most difficulties to teething. She does not use hire purchase but thinks it is hard to resist the salesmen, they are persistent and very good at inspiring guilt so you feel you have wasted their time instead of the other way round. The rent is 32/6d a week. They go out to the pictures and theatre occasionally, grandparents or friends will stay over on Saturday nights to babysit. They are saving up for a television.

Male INTVEE discusses the snobbery of church going people - getting dressed up just to look at each other and gossip.The children were bottle fed and female INTVEE would let them have the bottle as long as they wanted it. INTVER notes that it was obviously the husband\'s job to put the children to bed. The woman across the landing comes in regularly to borrow sugar or tea. The male INTVEE has invited an older couple who live down the stairs in to watch the television but they have never come, he thinks people think they are intruding if they go in to other people\'s houses. INTVER notes she and the INVTEEs had to shout at each other over the noise of the children who were only occasionally mildly and ineffectually rebuked.

Male INTVEE indignant about inequality of income - labourers on £9 a week while he thinks bosses earn £5000.Accommodation: The flat has been recently papered, they didn\'t do it themselves but husband had picked the paper. Male INTVEE quoted as saying "What more could you want to look out of the front windows onto the Pentland Hills, look out of the back windows over the Firth of Forth - beautiful, beautiful".INTVER\'s perceptions: INTVER describes the couple as of low intelligence and their house as "poor and shabby".

The blocks are designed in two living house blocks with a central connecting stair and lift block. The inclusive rent and rates is £1. 11. 4d a week. The electric underfloor heating costs another £1 a week. INTVEE decorated the flat herself replacing the original distemper with wallpaper. INTVER describes the living room as about 10\' x 13\' with a three piece suite of fairly modern design in moquette, dark green, and a large sideboard of 1930 vintage in light oak, a patterned carpet, fairly good German upright piano, a Ferguson television set. Three chairs are arranged almost in a row along one wall facing the piano and television. INTVEE says the heating doesn\'t come on until seven in the evening so the house doesn\'t warm up until bed time. It\'s on between seven at night and seven in the morning and again between eleven and three in the afternoon. INTVER describes the project as looking at the different aspects of life and work from the point of view of residents and services.INTVEE had been on the housing list since 1952. In the twelve years she had lived in Edinburgh she had been in unfurnished rooms and four or five different addresses. Only one move had been her choice, the others because of landlords putting up rent or altering agreements. She had wanted one of the old peoples houses in Milton Road West but when she was offered this flat she was told she had to take it. She liked the flat but was not keen on the district. She had a choice of second or ground floor. She moved in in 1958. She was told they are supposed to be luxury flats but she couldn\'t understand why they had put luxury flats out here, there was a stench from the gasworks. She says it\'s amazing what you\'ll do after 17 years in other people\'s houses. She works so is only in at weekends and nights. The flats are alright but the children are vagabonds - they run up and down the stairs, the entrance looks like a slum but they swear at you if you tell them off. The police patrol in their cars but take no notice of complaints.The road outside is noisy at night, teenagers make a noise and the police van - they never close the doors and have their radio on full blast. INTVER comments that there is a sort of circle with high buildings round it and if the police van was making a noise in the middle, the noise would bounce off all around but thinks it a good thing there is a police box there as the flats are too isolated. INTVEE likes the flat but thinks they are noisy, maybe the underfloor heating means they can\'t have solid floors. She thinks her floor is the best in the block, others don\'t realise they are living in flats and carry on creating noise. She says good morning and good evening to her neighbours but sees little of them, there is never any fuss about washing stairs or cleaning windows. If someone came to her door she would open it wide and let them in, some people keep the door almost closed. She came to Edinburgh from Glasgow for work and thought it was the coldest place ever, nobody seemed concerned with finer feelings or asked anything. In Glasgow, the office would have found you a place to stay and invited you for coffee [the summary is annotated in pencil here with "this is the most cherished myth of the Glaswegians"]. A friend of hers wouldn\'t come to visit her in winter because of the teddy boys, she thought this was nonsense, you get teddy boys anywhere.At weekends she might go in to town to meet friends or go the Dominion [cinema] in Morningside. She has met friends through work, on holiday, at clubs, digs, or through family. INTVER notices a clattering in the wall and INTVEE says it is the disposal chute, bottles rattle all the way down, some people will send bottles down in the middle of the night. She would like to go back to the West when she retires. She worries what the flats will be like in ten years time, some people who used to wash their stair don\'t anymore, the children are the problem, the flats are not designed for children, they go up and down the stairs making a noise which brings the mothers and fathers out. She has used hire purchase - for the piano and the television, she doesn\'t think there is anything wrong with it as along it\'s within bounds of income. She thinks the corporation had done a nice job of decorating, it was all contemporary, there were four shades of green on the walls and a tomato colour on the ceiling in the kitchen, not the usual cream walls and dark paint in most corporation places. But she had done some decorating herself even though she had never done it before.She would like more variety of shops like there is at Comely Bank. She won\'t use the Co-op here because an assistant will serve you with potatoes and then go and handle butter without washing her hands. She doesn\'t think much of Co-ops in general, she supports private enterprise. When asked if she votes Conservative she says yes. She misses having a good fruit shop nearby. One of the local doctors gave her aspirin for a metatarsul arch "I\'ve heard of aspirin curing a lot of things but have you heard of aspirins for a metatarsul arch?". She went and bought some pads, thinks there\'s something to be said for paying your own way and that doctors are allowed to have too many patients. She goes to the dentist every six months over in London street. She had arrived in Edinburgh not long after the welfare state was introduced and this was the only one she could get in to. She thinks the rents are high, there\'s a lot of moving in and out and she thinks this is becuase people can\'t keep up with the rents. The corporation say transfers are impossible, you have to get an exchange if you want to move but the district makes this diffcult. She thinks there is an attitude in the flats of "I\'m all right Jack" but she realises that some people like noise.', "'This boy is pretty poor, has always been a bad attender - his mother's fault.

INTVER describes the accommodation as "pretty unimaginative for 1961, but the insides are quite pleasant. The stairway was quite colourful with blue on the lower half instead of the dark green and I think it was off white on the upper part. The doors were brightly coloured with different colours and I even noticed there were some mats put out, obviously by the tenants, on the common stairway". The plaster of the ceiling of the INTVEE\'s house had recently fallen down for the third time. At one end of the living room is a bed which the INTVER thinks the husband sleeps in, with the wife sleeping in the other room. They have an "oldish rexine three piece suite in reasonable repair. Nothing about the house was tattie". Male interviewee feels a lot better since moving and thinks the balcony above their window in their previous house, which had been a ground floor house, gave the impression of something pressing on his head and had a lot to do with him feeling depressed. Their previous house was called a two-apartment but was in fact one room with a curtain, they preferred having separate rooms. There were far too many children where they lived before, they were always slamming doors and making noise in the afternoon. There was one woman who would say "you\'re ready for konking out you know" if they complained about the noise her children were making. They thought the corporation were wrong putting old people amongst so many children. The pipe underneath the bath of the woman upstairs leaked and flooded their house, soaked all the plaster and fungus began to grow. They had to live with the fungus for a year and a half, even in the larder, before anything was done. INTVER thinks the corporation had probably decided to move them rather than do repairs. They are active members of local clubs and they watch television every night. They read the Evening News. They think more women work now than used to and female interviewee thinks this might be to do with smoking - more women smoke now and are willing to work for the money they need for their own pleasure. It used to be only tinkers who smoked. Neither of them think it is a good idea for women to work. They don\'t think mothers chastise their kids, they are quite frightened of the local children. They spend about 15/- a week on coal which didn\'t go down too much in the summer as they needed the fire to heat water. 8/6 on rent and 10/- a week on electricity as they switched to a pre-paid meter which they prefer even if it means they pay more. They spend 10/- a week on gas. Male interviewee spends £1 a week on cigarettes and 10/- a week to rent the television. They don\'t save money and last had a holiday over 20 years ago, before the war. They contribute to the "store" house in Galashiels, which the INTVER thinks is a holiday centre run by St Cuthberts or Leith Provident, but have never been.Interviewer\'s thoughts: The couple have no strong interests and don\'t seem to get much from life. There was nothing apart from the ordinary everyday activities of running a house which kept them going. They derived some satisfaction from club activities a few hours a week.

Two children share one of the bedrooms and she and her husband share the other bedroom with their youngest son, aged 12. She doesn\'t like this arrangement but couldn\'t put all the children in the same room and won\'t put a bed in the living room as the council thinks she should do. The INTVER wonders why she didn\'t put bunks in the bedroom as she had said she had planned to do in their previous house. The family were offered a house in Granton or Niddrie, she wanted neither but she had no other choice, they were previously in a single end house which she owned but it got too overcrowded after the birth of their third child. She didn\'t like moving to Granton, it was rough and tough but the house had an extra room. INTVER notes that she complains extensively about the council\'s neglect of the district: They won\'t cultivate or build on the waste land at the corners, it runs waist high with weeds; the house hasn\'t been painted since they moved in. The nursery school however has been painted three times and the garden is tidied every week. She wanted the corporation to pay or help pay for a little shed in the front garden for the children\'s bicycles but it involved too much red tape so she gave up. She has had a year long battle with the corporation to repair her lavatory which leaked. She didn\'t pay the bill because the work wasn\'t finished and the corporation sued her. She says she tries to mobilise the local community but gets very little response. She has been offered a new maisonette house in Muirhouse which she thinks is lovely, but only if she takes her parents in. INTVER describes the INTVEE as "amply built, talkative and with a certain aggressiveness in her manner...of a manic depressive turn of mind and garrulous to a point".

She lives with her husband and three children (8, 5 and 3 yrs) in a three-apartment ground floor flat in a block of four. They previously lived in furnished rooms for £2 10s a week, they had no bath but an inside WC but it got too overcrowded with the children so applied for a corporation house. She prefers their new house, it is not as noisy, there are fewer children and more old people but not as handy for the shops. The bedrooms can be cold, the heating is through a back boiler fire in the sitting room. INTVEE says she likes to be by herself but INTVER thinks she is quite lonely and typical of a home-tied young mother with children to keep her at home but not enough to interest her there. INTVEE says there are always rows with the neighbours about the children. There are 13 children on her stair and 18 on the stair next door. She received no information about the house or neighbourhood before moving in. Her husband goes out to work early and comes back at 8 or 9 at night, he is active in the union. She thinks he has settled better and likes the neighbourhood but he doesn\'t have to live in it all day. She would like to go out to work part time when her youngest goes to school. The woman across the road looks after children during the day and three of them are coloured - their parents work at the university, there is also a coloured teacher at the new West Pilton School and she is very good. These are the only coloured people she is aware of, she thinks it\'s stupid that some people don\'t want to mix with them. On child discipline she is quoted as saying "Well if they absolutely just won\'t do what they\'re told I do hit them". Generally she thinks children are much cheekier than they used to be and parents don\'t seem to care.

Only one of the families apart from her own is still there out of the original six. Two went back to the areas they came from. She says the other five women on the stair were pally from the start and thought her snobbish for not joining in but she was unwell with her pregnancy. She didn\'t like them anyway, they were noisy and kept falling out. She says there are real slum types over in Pilton - always fighting, drunkenness and broken windows. INTVER comments that she thinks there is a lack of trust between INTVEE and her three year old child.

She says there is no communication with the private occupants on the other side of the road. While in the queue for the van she heard one private resident make a comment about the corporation tenants having it easy at the expense of people like her paying £4000 for a £3000 house. INTVEE reminded her that some of them had not had an easy life and that some of their husbands had been disabled as result of First World War. Her mother\'s tenement flat only had three rooms and even though she had two or three children she kept one room as a parlour and would never have any one in it, sometimes not even at new year but every Friday she took everything out and polished and scrubbed every inch of it. It had a paper fan in the fireplace. She used to do domestic work for three hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon and ran all the way there and back so she would be in for her children coming in from school. She doesn\'t resent the labour-saving devices the younger generation have but thinks more of the family allowance should go to old people who are expected to survive on miserable pensions. INTVER notes that there is a magi-coal fire, an obviously quite expensive and comfortable three piece suite, a lot of fresh roses from the garden, a radiogram, television set, pictures, mirrors and white covers on the back of the sofa. She has three grown up daughters, two went to fee-paying local authority schools and one to a private school. She had lost a young child to pneumonia. On child rearing she thinks you have to have a system and stick to it, a rigid one where all rewards and penalties understood and when a penalty has been paid no further reference ever made to the misdemeanour. When one of her daughters was late in and her husband said she was also late last week INTVEE would say "last week\'s past week". INTVER thought this system had been passed to her by her mother like a tangible heirloom. She also told her children that malicious gossip was taboo as was not putting people to the indignity of having to ask for help, if you heard someone was in trouble you went to help. Her father was killed in the First World War leaving her mother with five children. She told her daughters about menstruation at the age of 12. One of her daughter\'s has no lock on her bathroom door and the children wander in and out. INTVEE put a chair against the door, no one has every seen her in the bath. Her mother once gave her a row for being in her bare feet when there were visitors. She hates Leith because of the dirt, squalor, polluted atmosphere and overcrowding. There was more neighbourliness though with neighbours helping at births and deaths mainly because people couldn\'t afford doctors or undertakers, now the State provides these services. She has no time for class distinctions and is quoted as saying "There are only two classes - clean and dirty". INTVEE is proud of her family and the job she has done but now feels she is no longer needed, when INTVER says her husband still needs her she replies "Oh no he doesn\'t really need me.

INTVER describes the common vestibule as "scrappy looking, draughty and bare, the name board has an incongruous air of quality". The flat is described as "pleasantly deocrated in the modern style and well furnished with rugs and sitting suite and table and nice new wireless and 17" television. INTVER explains to the INTVEEs that the project aims to study the changing patterns of suburban life, life and work in the district from the point of view of both residents and the services and organised groups in the area. Their rent is £1. 19. 7d a week which they think is expensive. It is a two apartment flat with bathroom and kitchen. The noise transmission is very bad up and down the stairs, the noise deadening sideways is very good. They think people would move out if given the chance, the house is alright but surroundings are important, people with children spoil it for others. The corporation says children are not allowed to play in the grounds of the flats themselves and should go through to the playing fields but mothers don\'t send their children there because they were not sure they would come back in one piece. They can\'t send small children out because of other tough children in the neighbourhood. INTVER suggests their views aren\'t typical because they have had experience of better areas. They don\'t think people in the district are poor but think that they don\'t have the same ideas on controlling children or looking after the district as they do. They think residents are selfish, they don\'t seem to care about the effect of what they do on other people. INTVEEs have a car but have to constantly check on it. They moved in 10 months after the flats had been built, the lifts were a novelty and kids kept playing in them. They think the flats should have a caretaker and complain about the layout - the flats have four entrances and are too open which encourages kids to use them as pathways. There is however very little damage, some chalking on the walls, and this is down to the vigilance of the few who bother. They have asked for a transfer but have been told they don\'t have a chance unless they have a doctor\'s certificate. They think the council policy of grouping rough people all together, for example at Niddrie after Lochinvar Camp was cleared, is very bad. Boys take a short cut through the back gardens of the Swedish houses near the little road bridge that goes from Pilton Gardens to Crewe Road North. The corporation put up chestnut paling to stop them, there used to be chestnut palings in the semi-circle by the shops opposite the flats. The shops here put a halfpenny or penny on all the prices. They refer to a screening process which they had to pass before getting the flat, if they had failed they thought they would be sent to Niddrie, they thought people should be mixed up. The only people who\'ve managed to keep a garden have managed to do it by standing in the garden with a shotgun. Female INTVEE says she always opens her front door wide, but others don\'t - they are afraid of gossip or that people will peer in and see what\'s going on inside. There is a lot of gossip, it\'s easy to see into the kitchen door and through a flat. Their dream is to find a little cottage that needs done up. They moved in in 1958. They had previously lived in a room in Leith. It wasn\'t very nice, they paid 35/- a week. They found it odd adjusting to not always being in the same room as each other after they moved.', "'Not at school yet, not very brilliant.'Relatives in survey: 20.43, 20.42", 'Correspondence about the proposed merger of the University with Moray House Institute of Education including minutes and papers for project group meetings and background papers.', 'Copy of Report to the committee of Vice-Chancellor and Principals Steering Committee for Efficiency Studies January 1985', 'Correspondence about the proposed merger of the University with Moray House Institute of Education including minutes and papers for project group meetings, background papers and correspondence with solicitors.', '"IQ 72.

There was more strictness with children not allowed to play on the stair because of inconvenience to neighbours and noise.

She now works in Leith and so has been Muirhouse and likes the look of the buildings going up near the skyscrapers, she thinks they might be the Scottish Special houses - two apartment. She was appalled at the high number of children in the area. She was offered another house in Muirhouse but again refused as, like the first, it was surrounded by children. The sanitary inspector chastised her for having some old lino in her garden which she hadn\'t got round to disposing of. INTVER phones the council to see if she is still on the list and reassures her that she is but she is worried she will have to take the next offer or stay in Sighthill until it is condemned.

Additions were made against the names of the early graduates, probably by later Professors, adding designations such as 'minister verbi' or, for example, 'Primarius, prius Regens' against the name of Henry Charteris and Patrick Sands, who weer in the first class of graduates, and who became Principal in 1597 and 1620 respectively. The Register records all graduates up to 1712, and medical graduates from 1710 up to 1809.The Register itself was active in the University until 1809, and it can be safely said that it played a central role in the life of the institution for over 200 years. Many of the signatures in the volume are of key figures in the life of the University, and include those of Robert Rollock, the first Principal, William Drummond of Hawthornden, the Poet and Benefactor to the University, Robert Leighton, and Hugh Blair.

The amount of borrowing and lending that goes on is phenomenal, one woman had raised subscriptions amongst the neighbours to cover her rent arrears of £24.

The house is semi-detached with a small garden at the front and a large garden at the back which INTVEE says is too big for her to manage. There are three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs and two rooms downstairs, the kitchen leads of the back downstairs room which is the only room with a coal fire. The front downstairs room has an electric fire and is used as a sitting room and dining room. INTVER writes "the room was conventionally and comfortably furnished and decorated, buffy-cream wallpapered walls, patterned carpet, grey moquette three piece suite, modernish conventional dining room table and chairs, a radiogram that looked like a highly polished bureau". After marrying in 1939, INTVEE gave up work and moved with her husband to a rented property in Sighthill, it was a rural district at this time with a Rural Institute. The Admiralty took over all the houses in Sighthill which were vacant and filled them with English dockers who were bussed to Rosyth every morning. She enjoyed working there. The moved to their present house in 1953 buying the house from her father in law. INTVEE returned to work when her youngest child was 5 years old. INTVEE and children listen to the radio in the evening particularly Radio Luxembourg, once a month they go to the SNO Symphony concerts. INTVEE describes the district as working class, the residents are working class people who have saved and bought their own houses. The people moving into the district now are younger, they have more money earlier which she thinks is a good thing, it\'s important for young married couples to get their own house and not live with in-laws. There are plenty shops nearby. INTVEE uses the shops at the west end, the local butcher, the co-op in the Boswall Parkway and Hebburns, a greengrocer on Granton Road. The No. 19 bus is one of the best routes in Edinburgh and the No. 21 one of the most interesting. She knows her neighbours but they are not in and out of people\'s houses. INTVEE knows a teacher at Craigmillar School who says it\'s a tough district, the phrase for going to prison is "in England".', 'Diploma in Social Study 1938.

Two of her sons were rounded up by the police when they were standing with friends outside the youth club even though she protested that they weren't this gang.Hire Purchase/Finance: The women in the district are scared of the men because they buy so much on hire purchase and daren't tell their husbands how much debt they've run up and so run around after them, cleaning their shoes etc. INTVEE doesn't approve of gambling that racks up debt but likes horse racing and playing housie-housie [bingo].Thoughts on class: There are the working class and everyone else. Edinburgh upper classes are two faced - she met many while she was working in a shop in town. Doesn't like Morningside in particular - pride and poverty. She always buys their christmas cards from the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship.

It is noted that she is enthusiastic about a young relative's decor which is modern black and white with brilliant scatter cushions.Neighbourhood: INTVEE has one or two friends near by but on the whole has little to do with her neighbours. She thinks the neighbourhood has gone down hill since she first moved in but two new families could not be nicer so maybe it was starting to pick up.Family: INTVEE married late at the age of around 40 yrs. She received a widow's and orphan's pension. She went out to work sewing at other people's homes. She thinks babies wear next to nothing compared to the layers of petticoats they used to wear. She thinks this is an improvement but thinks the discontinuance of the binder, used to keep the navel in, is a bad thing.Personal finance: Pays 26/- a week rent compared with 11/- when she first moved in.Routine: Monday is washing day with a friend to tea in the afternoon. Tuesday morning is spent shopping with a free afternoon, maybe for knitting. Wednesday she has coffee at a friend's. Thursday is heavy cleaning day. Friday sometimes shopping locally or in town.

There were about 45 men in the main large public bar at the time of his visit. He describes the interior as "rather dully decorated in a 1939-ish style. The walls were stucco, mainly cream with little red and green stripes in it. There were two rather crude nautical pictures, which were rather more like designs. The floors were rather nondescript dirty composition tile, the furniture inoffensive, solid style, mainly rexine. There was one notice telling customers that passing of betting slips was forbidden, another saying that gambling was forbidden. There was one charity box for playing fields with a little picture of children playing in the streets. and a caption "keep them off the streets". Most of the men were in groups, only one or two were by themselves. Most of the men were above thirty but researcher talks to a younger man who says he won\'t find many younger men in on a Thursday night. The man works at Duncan\'s chocolate factory where the wages are not good at first and it can get terribly hot in some of the rooms, up to 100 degrees.

Anecdote about a man, possibly Indian, wanting to adopt him and sibling when they lived in Niddrie but his mother moved them away. Other topics discussed include: Accommodation; neighbours; children and young people.Accommodation: INTVEE didn\'t think the house was bad but inconvenient - the washbasin was positioned up above the bath and the coal hole is located in the kitchen which means the coalman has to come through the living room and dust gets everywhere. They have friends in a prefab in Muirhouse and the coal hole has a lockable outside hatch. He thinks the house is more important than the district, particularly hygiene and how the house is set out. In the older parts of the city there is overcrowding and TB. He would like a larger house but thinks there is a trend in people not wanting to come to the district.Neighbours: Neighbours not as important to men, shopping different too "When the man goes shopping he just wants to go and get the messages and come away but women treat it as a chance to blether for an hour". Quarrels with neighbours over children playing in the back green and people not cleaning the stairs when it is their turn. The wives are supposed to have the green one or two days a week and they share on a Sunday, a quarrel ensued when one woman had her washing line out on all the posts on a Sunday and was asked to take it down from three of the posts.Children and young people: Another source of dispute was other children\'s noise, playing gramophones and stomping on the floor. He would like to see more play areas, kids can\'t play in back greens because of washing, he sends his to Pilton Park. If they play in the small patch at the front the neighbours complain about the noise. Pays half a crown for kids to go the Good Shepherds club after school on a Wednesday. He thought young people led more exciting lives now and discipline was slacker because of women going out to work.

No diagnosis given.', 'INTVEEs have recently moved to the Midlothian County Council area, they would have liked a corporation house, which they thought were superior to Edinburgh corporation housing, but male INTVEE\'s employer refused to sign the form saying it was necessary for him to live near his place of work as he owned a car and because they had to keep council houses to entice employees from further afield. Prior to moving their children had gone to Wardie School. They have no time for "fee-paying nonsense" but felt it would be penalising the children to send them to Granton when the neighbouring children went to Wardie. Male INTVEE went to Granton School and then David Kilpatricks, leaving at 14 and serving an apprentice as a mill wright with Bruce Peebles. He is now employed by Ferrantis. He says the factory at Crewe Toll is organised into "firms", each with a general manager and four or five managers. INTVER asks about the old boy network and he comments that in some firms there is a prevalance of Edinburgh Academy boys, Daniel Stewart boys or Catholics. Female INTVEE went to school in Barrhead, she regrets not going to university – she entered the civil service instead. They think Wardie provided a good education but no more so than a non fee-paying school could have done. They spoke with enthusiasm of the cuisinaire system of arithmetic teaching. Male INTVEE is keen for one of his sons to go into nuclear physics as he thinks there is much expansion in this area. Female INTVEE thinks it is a pity that there is a divide between the arts and science and this seems to be widening. Male INTVEE talks of the eccentrics employed at Ferrantis - mathematicians being the most eccentric, one of them goes about the factory in a black cloak and monocle. He is quoted as saying, "you might say it\'s comparable to art, anybody with a creative gift in science is given the maximum encouragement. A firm like Ferrantis will put up with almost anything if somebody comes away with something really new, if he really has a creative spark, they\'ll leave them loose in the lab". He thinks a degree could facilitate people getting in to Ferrantis, but not necessarily getting on. INTVER notes that she is beginning to question the idea that there was a great drive in Scotland for education before the war as she has heard many stories about interviewees or their parents being offered bursaries to higher education but having to decline because families would not let them take them up. Male INTVEE says, while he wants his children to do well, he is focussed on his own job and prospects, he doesn\'t believe any sacrifice is worthwhile and is quoted as saying, "I might have been able to get my children into one of the Merchant Company Schools, but quite honestly I wouldn\'t be prepared to pay those high fees". He wants his children to have interesting careers and is quoted as saying, "I want my children to enjoy their work and be interested in it".

Best to have babies at home, not be wakened up at 5 for a cup of tea. One doctor had been strict about staying in bed after the birth - 10-14 days. In hospital they like you to get up on the second day. Great pressure to breast feed in the Western, they insist on it. One INTVEE thought they did better on cows milk than on national dried milk. The younger INTVEE thought breastfeeding was too much work and too much embarrassment. Two INTVEEs thought breastfeeding was easier and you were not so tied down. Some were believers in putting a raw egg in the last bottle og the day to make them sleep right through. One INTVEE thought regular feeding was not necessarily the right thing to do; they wouldn\'t wake a baby to feed it but only feed when it cried. The district nurse had told one INTVEE to feed regularly but the doctor had said to feed on demand. One had been told "babies only cry for three things - wet, wind and hunger. If he\'s not wet and you\'ve made sure there\'s no wind, then feed him". One INTVEE thought secondary school was the right time to learn the facts of life, another said tell them when they are young and then there is no fuss. Their mothers told them nothing about sex. Two of them hadn\'t known how the baby would be born when they were pregnant. "We are all working class, but there are different classes within the working class".', '"Hysterical but capable.

She had been brought up in a single end in Leith along with five siblings and so appreciates the space in her new home in Muirhouse. Previously had lived in Craigmillar but found the inhabitants rough and wild, too many broken windows and fights. Her only complaint about the house is that there is only one fireplace and no other means of heating, which means electric radiators or oil stoves in the rest of the rooms which is expensive. She had previously lived in Pilton and missed her neighbours and the proximity of the nursery or "toy school" for her pre-school children. She thinks £2 rent is high but worth it.Family Life: There are distinct roles within the marriage which the INTVEE blames herself for, "Only the other morning a neighbour mentioned having had a cup of tea brought to bed by her husband", this had shaken her to the core "I think I\'ve just been one big fool".Health and health services: The INTVEE likes the health visitors but not the doctors who she feels are too brusque and would get cross when called out to see a child who was ill in the morning but was fine by the time of their visit later in the day.

Fridges and washing machines are not thought to be a luxury but a necessity and should have been put in the flats. They had originally been supplied in the prefabs but misused and taken out. INTVEEs are not impressed with the Corporation as landlords - their complaints didn\'t get anywhere and tenancies were not transferred to children. General agreement that owning a house was a burden and responsibility. "Let me pay the rent, they do the worrying". One INTVEE had waited 21 years for a house, another had wanted a house in the Boswalls but was told that was for special cases, possibly for people with TB because of the good air. "Oh everyone is after Clermiston" but agreed that the rent was too high. One INTVEE offered keys to a property in Muirhouse Drive known as "The Grubber". Reasons for choosing houses - "nearness to work and the best locality you can get". One interviewee thought most of the people in Clermiston were those working in the nationalised industries as he drives through there in his lorry every morning and noticed everyone at the bus stop wore uniforms. Opinion divided as to whether police should live in the district - risk that they may be seen as ordinary people and respect for them would be lost but it gives a feeling of security having them there. Dislike of tendency of point system of house allocation to group closely related families together, creates jealousy and inquisitiveness.

Agreement on ineffectiveness of youth employment services. One male interviewee thought it was great that girls got sex education at school "Contraceptives and all that. Most girls now get married and work for three years before they have their families. This sexual education is a great thing because it facilitates this delay". Remarks about Russia using female labour and one interviewee recalled seeing Russian boats with a female crew and captain.

They discovered that this was not because of the generosity of McTaggart and Mickel but because they had built the houses to a higher density than they were allowed to, this piece of land was left over and could not be built on. The association got in touch with the Department of Agriculture and the corporation eventually took it over. The factors Gumley took 10/- deposit for the keys, the association discovered no one had ever got this back, there was always some minor damage on account of which the money was retained. The ratepayers took their case to court and won, £400 was repaid to 1200 householders. They get little assistance form the corporation because they refused to accept the conditions - provide educational classes on account that the young people of Pilton were getting more important further education than a local night school could proved - professional exams etc. the Wardie Association however were very in with the corporation with all their country dances, handicrafts etc. He thinks the corporation are now punishing the people of East Pilton by lumping them together with West Pilton and just using the term Pilton.', 'INTVEEs son left school at 15 and is serving an apprenticeship at Bruce Peebles while attending night school.

They have no children. They have lived there for 2 and half years and were on the waiting list for three and half years. They had been living in one room which had ben divided in two by hardboard, a sub-let in a large old house for which they paid 30/-. They think their 3 apartment flat with all modern conveniences for under £2 a week is a bargain. INTVER describes the house as "well furnished indeed, both as to comfort and quality. The quite expensive three-piece suite had decent lines and is upholstered in grey instead of the prevalent cherry. There is a patterned all-over-fitted carpet". Most of the furniture is on hire-purchase except the furniture in the small spare room which they got by foregoing one holiday. Wife likes to read and is currently reading a Harry Spring novel. She wants to get a bookcase. The husband collects records and says he likes the Teds - Cliff Richard, Adam Faith, his wife prefers the songs from South Pacific, The King and I etc. They like the flat very much but do not like the district. They had not anticipated that the district would affect them but had not reckoned on the approaches to the flat being so unpleasant and the interference from local children - they put the lifts out of order or play in them, pinch bikes and mess up the landings. They deplore the absence of a caretaker. The cleaning of the landings and stairs is the responsibility of the tenants but they have refused to do it on more than one occasion because of the filthy state it was in. They sent for the sanitary who cleared it up. There had been a tenant\'s association when the flats were first occupied but this had lapsed. They think there has been a lot of movement in and out of the block. Husband asks INTVER "Do you think people are getting more snobbish?" and is quoted as saying "well in the old days nobody had anything and nobody expected to have anything. It was all share and share alike. You\'d help out somebody in the same boat as you were yourself. Once people begin to get on their feet they start looking round to see what more they can get and then there\'s all this competition and it\'s each for himself". They both work. He works with people from Newhaven who he says are clannish and the older generation terribly superstitious - they will never say "salmon" or "pig", it always has to be "red fish" or "curly tail". INTVER asks if he knows about the Free Fishers and he thinks it is a friendly society to which members pay a small weekly contribution. If a Newhaven girl marries a man outside the Newhaven families, her husband is not allowed to become a member and her sons can\'t be members but sons of a Newhaven man who marries outside are allowed to join. He is hostile to the union and there is a general feeling amongst seamen that it doesn\'t represent their interests. He says the seamen\'s strike the previous year was against the union and not their employers. He no longer feels able to vote Labour since discovering the unions do nothing to promote the welfare of their members, he would not go as far as voting Tory so he abstained at the last election. He thinks the unions must have considerable funds that they could invest in industry. The wife votes Labour. They can buy little luxuries if they feel like it and husband is quoted as saying "Take biscuits for instance. When I was a lad, though we got enough to eat, a biscuit was a thing quite unknown in the family. Now we eat maybe three or four pounds a week".', '"This boy is very slow at school, probably dull and backward. His parents were old when he was born. Decent hard-working people.

The shift workers are mainly those who have grown up in the gasworks. There is a formal and informal structure, at times of crises certan people come forwad and they stand out and are noticed afterwards. The operations are not continuously dangerous but there are critical moments in the process and dangers to avoid e.g. they must not allow the gasholder to become empty adn they must not allow the calorific value of the gas to fall below a certain point otherwise they are fined. They mustn't allow foul gas to be put out or they are fined. There has been a management reorganisation since nationalisation, at first there was a centralisation locally and subsequently there has been a further centralisation whereby Scotland has been divided into three divisions. As a result of this process some of the job titles don't make much sense. The resident knows an employee of Fleming's Inkworks and there is some discussion of the shift patterns there, he knows men who have refused better paid positions because it would mean leaving their shift group. Annual holidays are arranged in seven periods divided among seven groups, so a man can tell his holiday dates seven years ahead. Running regular shifts is the perfect opportunity to run a second job and many do - smallholdings, deliveries, insurance books - the gasworks pays less than average but second jobs are often more to do with providing an outlet for skills and capacties not utilised.", '"Very quiet man, never out.

INTVEE is married with children. He had grown up in Leith and Wardieburn before the Second World War and lived in Niddrie before moving to Muirhouse. He now lives in a five apartment corporation house. He thinks Niddrie is a rough area and has a much worse reputation than Pilton and Muirhouse. A friend who lives in Niddrie concealed their address when looking for a job, he doesn\'t think this happens in the Pilton area. He prefers the villa typed houses to the multi-storey blocks which look too much like barracks and lack variation. INTVER suggests Edinburgh people in general weren\'t brought up with gardens and do not know how to look after them. INTVEE disagrees but thinks on the whole people don\'t bother much about gardens, he doesn\'t have the time. He doesn\'t think Scottish people are bothered about having a separate living room and dining room, rooms better used as bedrooms. INTVER comments that he thinks it is more useful to have two rooms in the age of television as it tends to dominate a room, this could be got over by making bedrooms into bed sitting rooms. INTVEE prefers small pubs, he occasionally goes to the Doo\'cot but it\'s much too overcrowded. Mostly he\'ll go out of the area, perhaps to Newhaven, but if he can\'t be bothered he\'ll go to the Duke. The beer is bad in the Anchor at Granton and it\'s a bit rough. Him and his wife say hello to their neighbours but don\'t bother too much with them. He thinks the community associations form into cliques and are not really interested in new members. You can now go into pubs with your wife, you couldn\'t do this before the war. He thinks there is some ruling that there shouldn\'t be too many pubs on estates. His 15 year old son goes out on his bike with his friends, he doesn\'t know where they go. Him and his wife don\'t go out together much, by the time the children were in bed, they couldn\'t be bothered. They go out separately, he stays in and looks after the children on a Thursday, he\'ll changed nappies and feed them. He wouldn\'t be seen out pushing a pram. He thinks the television is a blessing and a curse - it can rule the place and the children want it on at mealtimes. He really likes home made soup, not from a tin or packet. On Sundays they always have a joint and have their meal about 4pm. On weeknights their main meal is usually at 5pm. They have breakfast and sandwiches for lunch. The family budget is run by his wife. The INTVER thinks it strange that interviewee hasn\'t had a holiday in five years as he thinks he is earning quite well, thinks it must be more to do with habit. They go down to Cramond foreshore quite a bit in the summer. INTVER asks him if he thought of running a car and quotes his reply as "No, not on my wage". He buys furniture on hire purchase, it has been quite a change moving into a five roomed house. He identifies as working class but interviewer points out that he has a bank account and this could be a mark of being middle class. INTVEE thinks it is do with jobs but concedes there are some breaking down of class distinction and it is no longer as clear cut as it used to be. He dislikes the system of five doctors at the surgery and would prefer to always see the same doctor.INTVER\'s thoughts: Thinks that the INTVWE lives a contended if somewhat dull life with no particular interests.

He now works at the Wireworks, he likes the job but not the people, his truck turned over recently and no one came to help him lift it. He is a member of the Transport and General Workers Union. The AEU does most of the organising in the Wireworks and there is also a craft union which organises the weavers of the wire cloth which is the main product of the factory. The works makes its own wire, starting with copper and drawing it down from half inch to 32 gauge which they then weave into wire cloth used in paper manufacture. It\'s exported all over the world. He has a car which is his main hobby, he keeps it in garages at the back of the shops on East Granton Road, it\'s an open garage with about 11 cars and there is plenty space to work. He does the car up every year before they go on holiday; they go to stay with family in England. He is painting the hall but it plays up his peptic ulcer for which he has been put on a milk diet. At the end of the interview he tells his children to go and wash their faces and put on their pyjamas for bedtime.

Granton got its bad name from neighbouring Wardieburn "terrible gangs are based in Wardieburn", although the Boswalls are fine. Neighbours described as "covetous".Male INTVEE is originally from Leith and they both hope to go back there. Their street and the other Boswalls are fine but in general they think the area is rough, the language from youngsters is terrible and they see children raking in bins for bottles to sell.Housing: Complaints about the Corporation as landlords - they wouldn\'t put in electric plugs and there are none in the house, no proper playgrounds for children. The INTVER describes the house as "clean enough but in a state of complete chaos, there was literally not a clean inch of space, the very window-sills were inches deep in objects. There was no chair which was not piled high with garments or papers and the bed settee was also littered. This had a rather unappetising look because of the dark brown rough blankets and flanelette sheets". INTVEES have always disliked Granton and would have preferred Lochend.They have not pursued an exchange as Granton has got such a bad name because of Wardieburn. The rent is 26/3 having gone up from 10/2 in the last 12 years. A son who works at Bruce Peebles pays £3 board but grumbles about it.Finance and employment: The wife would like to work but husband won\'t let her, he is quoted as saying "No woman\'s going to keep me and my kids2. He works night shifts and earns 10/- a week, he also recieves a disability pension. He goes to Leith for his Friday night pint but assures INTVER that this doesn\'t touch his wife\'s money.INTVEEs think the schools are too lenient and parents do not discipline their children. There children are always put to bed early. Female INTVEE thinks she was too strict with the older children, mainly because she had to be both mother and father when her husband was in the forces during the war.

They had a dining table in the sitting room and a side-board" when asked if they use it they say never do. "There were one or two rather fussy plastic ornaments, and a budgerigar and a tortoise and a piano too". The corporation had given them the keys and said they could have a look before deciding if they wanted it but felt under pressure to accept or wait a long time for another one.

The husband has lived in the area from the age of 7 and knew his wife from school. He ran wild as a child round the district in the 1930s and 1940s, his father was in the army and a drunk. Their stair is nice but noisy. Their complaints are mainly about the quality and design of the house: Windows have rusted, floors are not nailed down and are noisy and uneven, the doors are warped, the walls and ceilings are not square and it was difficult to put up patterned wallpaper - they used a plumb line all the way round but it still came out wrong. The stairs are narrow and have glass windows at foot level which get broken. Tenants are responsible for cleaning the windows but can\'t do it themselves from the outside. The flat is arranged along a corridor running parallel with the front of the building with cupboards and bedrooms on one side. The living room is at the front with the kitchen leading off. The only room to adjoin the neighbouring flat is a bedroom, some of the other flats in the block have adjoining living rooms with the INTVER thinks must be "hell". INTVEEs do not like the arrangement of the coal cellar which is immediately behind the front door and means the coal man has to come into the hall, shut the front door to be able to open the cellar door, shut the cellar door before opening the front door and so on for each sack. Husband says if the house was his he\'d knock through a wall to make an entrance chute directly into the cellar. In the living room there is only one long wall against which you can put furniture, the front wall has windows and the other walls are broken up with the fireplace, recesses and access to kitchen. Despite these complaints they are quite pleased with it on the whole but would prefer to be in a house on their own. They think the district is quite rough. There is a shortage of shops and nowhere for the children to go and play. Muirhouse Drive is dangerous because of parked vans. The wife misses having a shopping centre as somewhere to go to break up the monotony of being at home with the children. The vans don\'t carry a wide range of goods so you don\'t know what else is available. In the summer they spend as much time as possible at Cramond foreshore, there is nowhere else to go. Husband thinks the district will not be as rough in ten years time when the children have grown up. They go to church but not the white church which doesn\'t have a holy atmosphere and looks like a laundry. Husband thinks Cramond foreshore should be developed more as a recreation place for Edinburgh, he had heard the corporation were negotiating to extend the forefront road right through to South Queensferry but this depended on the Dalmeny estate.

She thinks it would be a lot easier if she could find a job to do. She had previously worked at a house where there was a group of nurses, preparing meals, but after the National Health Act they wanted a resident help so she gave that up. She hasn\'t worked for twelve years. INTVER thinks she is suffering from loneliness, she says she wouldn\'t talk to her neighbours about how she is feeling. When her parents were alive they also lived with her and her husband. She thinks the trouble with the area is the that there are too many children about, children from other streets would come and play in hers. She is quoted as saying "I know I\'m nervous but I just can\'t stand them playing. The Corporation should prevent them from playing in the street. They go out to the back green and I have to turn them out of there and the neighbours don\'t like it, but they should keep them out themselves". She thinks the Corporation should not mix up families but take the bad ones out and put them together somewhere. There are seven children on the stair and they chalk the walls, she has to clean it off. She goes to church regularly and is quoted as saying "Some of the nicest people I know round here are Catholics. I know people say \'oh Catholics, they\'re a bit rough\' but I don\'t find that I think they\'re very nice people". She does some sewing and needlework and takes small jobs from her neighbours, however, not many have been round since her husband died. She is thinking of getting a television.

The rent has now come down and they consider it a bargain. They like the flat because it is their own, they think the scullery is well designed. The corporation look after the grass which surround the building. The drying cupboard is inadequate. They think the area is definitely rough probably on account of the number of children. The corporation beleiv3ed the 2 multi storey blocks would improve the district but they think this was a mistake.

Interviewer is male.INTVEEs live in one of area\'s old people\'s flats built by the Department of Health for Scotland about four years ago. Two changes have been made since they were built - the washing lines have been moved from the far end to just outside the kitchen windows and the children\'s playground, which was just outside the houses, has been removed. They hadn\'t objected to local children playing there but it had attracted children from all over and they often made noise up to 11pm. Prior to moving to this apartment the interviewees had lived for 17 years in a four apartment flat, also in the area. They requested to move to a smaller house once all their children had left home. They are both originally from Leith and had lived in a butt and ben with five of them in a room and kitchen. They slept in the kitchen while the children slept in the main room. INTVER doesn\'t think they have particularly warm memories of Leith. They don\'t think there is much difference between neighbour relations in Leith and North Edinburgh estates. When they moved from Leith they enjoyed having more space and a proper bathroom. Female INTVEE thinks there are big changes in the upbringing of children and says there are too many mothers out working now when they should be looking after their children. She is quoted as saying "you see children flung out around here at 7 o\'clock in the morning - just little toddlers. It\'s dreadful". She is also quoted as saying "Nowadays it seems that the women get all these things on HP [hire purchase] and then have to go out to work to earn the money, whereas they could do without all these things". She remembers staying up to 3am to make clothes, all the women in her day used to make their own clothes. The house had been awful when they first moved in - all the walls were running wet. Male interviewer was annoyed when tobacco vouchers were dropped because people were complaining that smokers were given money in this way. Generally thought the workmanship of the house was bad. INTVER comments that the house was very clean and quite modern looking "Generally apart from the three piece suite which was rexine, the furniture had quite a prosperous almost middles class look to it". There was a large curtain in the living room to hide the bedroom part. They are quite pleased with the area and think the people are nice.

The fire is an open hearth one with a Sofona type fire place and heated water at the back. The walls are all papered. The kitchenette has an old gas cooker and a set of low cupboards with work tops and a sink by the window. There is an airing cupboard with hot water tank. The bathroom is a combined shower, wash basin and WC. She never uses the shower and is arranging for the corporation to install a bath instead. INTVER went for a look into the courtyard at the back and notes that it is closed in by two fairly large four storey blocks of maisonettes on the north side, the old peoples houses on the east, three storey blocks on the south and a line of slightly larger single storey old peoples houses in the middle, meant for couples. The four storey blocks have balconies which the interviewer is surprised to see cluttered up with furniture and thinks this is not a good use of them, especially as they would be pleasant in the summer being south facing. The INTVER notes that some people have washing hanging out on the balconies. There is a drying green and tarmac space with swings and roundabouts and the interviewer thinks this could be the recreation area that older people have complained about. INTVER notices 4 vans in the street and doesn't think they look like they have a designated spot so are unlikely to provide much of a meeting place for shoppers. Overall the INTVER thinks the arrangement of the site is successful in that there are plenty of old people together and they know each other well but there are also plenty young people.Work: INTVEE worked for 42 years in a series of different cleaning jobs - in the Royal Infirmary, on the railways and in the Wire Works.She used to go along to the West Pilton Old Age Pensioners Club but there was too much quarrelling. A club was set up with help of the Muirhouse Community Assocation for residents of the maisonettes which she enjoyed but it ended after a couple of years due to lack of funds. She doesn't use the vans for shopping because they are too expensive but goes to Hays in West Granton Road and the Co-op there which she prefers to the Co-op in Pennywell Road because she meets some of her friends from Leith there. Her main expense is coal, she uses at least 2 bags a week. She usses 6d worth of gas a day and 1/- a week goes on electricity. Her rent is 17/6d. She gets a pension and is on assistance.INTVER's thoughts: Does not think this is a very full interview but gets the impression it is a pleasant life with plenty of company, plenty to do and thinks the INTVEE is pleased with her house which is homely and easy to run.Kinship diagram included.", "Agendas, papers and minutes for meetings of the Management Information Services Committee, correspondence about a visit by Professor Ewart (who had been invited by the Secretary to report on the timescales for the introduction of new staff and student record systems), a copy of a May 1984 report entitled 'Edinburgh University - Provision of Management Information Services' and a copy of a February 1985 report entitled 'University of Edinburgh: Provision of a management Information Service' both produced by Professor Ewart, and comments on both reports from within the University.", "MOSLTY CORRESPONDENCE REGARDING THE SALE OF ASSETES, PARTICULARY MANUSCRIPTS (MOST NOTABLY AUDUBON'S 'BIRDS OF AMERICA')", '"IQ 72, terribly dull, but when he leaves school he will be a successful farmer."Siblings: 30.122, 30.121, 30.120', 'Agendas, papers and minutes for Court meetings.', 'Copy of the University\'s submissions to the ESRC for their Submission Rates Survey, and a copy of the ESRC "Social Sciences" newsletter Issue 16 October 1992.

The backyard is full of rocks. she sometimes took her older child into the square at the front where you can lock the gate so it is quite safe but there are often older children who use bad language. There is no water or bathroom in their room or on the stair. She shares a WC with one other family. She says the sanitary man had told her she wasn\'t overcrowded because they have an 11 foot ceiling. INTVER comments that it is crowded with quite a lot of furniture - kitchen cabinets, children\'s pram and cot, studio couch which made a double bed at night, a large table in the middle of the room. INTVER writes "The room generally was very untidy not excessively dirty but rather smelly. They had a large cupboard which her husband had made into a minute kitchen, fitted with shelves and a gas cooker, there was a small open coal fire, television and radio-gram, and dartboard". INTVEE says the only thing she will miss is the high ceiling. They don\'t go out much as a couple, she goes dancing once a week, her husband spends all his spare time playing darts. She sews and knits and has an electric sewing and knitting machine. She thinks her husband\'s wage is £15 a week and he pays the rent and bills. In their new house they are going to take out the coal fires and install Magi-coal electric ones. They\'re going to have an immersion and electric radiators and get a new Creda electric cooker. They have the radiogram on hire purchase but her husband doesn\'t approve. She said her mother told her that before the war they always had a choice of three keys, now they put you back 6 months if you don\'t accept. You get the keys the day before and a week\'s rent is due the next day. They have been to see Muirhouse and think it is nice with the sea and the country, not as rough as Pilton. They liked the nine-story blocks going up but as it will be another few months before they are finished they have taken the place they have been offered.', '"This woman is said to be deficient, has had two black children, the first when she was 16.

There are six families on the stair. INTVER notes that the wife was out when he first arrived and although she appeared later on he didn\'t get to speak to her as much as he would have liked. Female INTVEE thinks their part of the district is nice but is rougher further down where there are broken windows and fences but husband says people always think their own part is nicer. They have two children under school age and they are not yet used to playing down below and away from their mother. Husband goes to a pub in Easter Road every evening but is not bothered by the travel, he is quoted as saying "Well, it just means I go off a bit earlier and come back a bit later. That\'s one of the things you have to put up with if you move out here". They are both pleased with the house, they could use more cupboard space. They had been given the keys so they could come and have a look but were told they\'d be another 6 months on the waiting list if they declined. The Clerk of Works had visited to explain things to them. There are composition tiles on top of the concrete floors which they think is cold. Wife goes to the Pennywell Co-op once a week and also uses the vans but they are expensive and try to get you to take credit. A Murchies van comes round at ten or eleven at night which she thinks is useful, it sells practically everything. The chip van comes round at 7.30. The ice cream vans are a nuisance, they seem to come round every ten minutes and they have fights with their children about it. When asked about local entertainment male INTVEE says "it\'s just nil down here, except the "Emby"" which is too far away. He had been in the Doo\'cot and thinks it is awful, too crowded and takes ages to get served and the beer is bad. He thinks the lack of competition is why it\'s so bad. They have changed their electric meter to a shilling in the slot one even though it is more expensive as they don\'t like getting bills.', '"This child is dull. She is an adopted illegitimate child.

INTVER notes that the centre staircase smells of disinfectant with various scrawlings on the wall, describes it as "almost sordid". The interview was conducted in the one of the couples living room which the INTVER describes as being about 14\' by 10\' with a large window at one end and a sophone type fireplace which could burn smokeless fuel and heated water in the tank beside it. A gas attachment allows for easy lighting. One of the couples explicitly identifies as working class although INTVWER thinks the general appearance of the house is more middle class but also comments that the floor is lino with one small mat and in a middle class home a large carpet would be a necessity. The INTVER also comments that the three piece suite looks "respectable" and probably cost as much as it would to furnish a whole house from the sale rooms. Both families had been there for 3 years but had just found out that part of the ground at the back belonged to them. There was no fence but as soon as it was marked out they would plant grass for the children. They had hoped to have open views to the coast but flats had been put up in the way. There are now more and more children in a small space which causes a lot of fights. INTVER comments that there seems to have been little exchange of information between the corporation and tenants. Some families had dug up their gardens so as to discourage children from playing in them but then they come to the gardens that aren\'t dug up and sometimes mark washing which is hanging up to dry. There is a complaint about the pram cupboards provided on the ground floor being damp. INTVEEs think Muirhouse is the black sheep of the housing estates, although Niddrie is worse. Definitely not enough shops, in Clermiston the shops were finished before the housing. The only chemist is at West Pilton, there\'s no greengrocers or tobacconist. The vans are expensive and come round at their own convenience not at times convenient for shoppers, they come round at 10.30 at night and are very noisy. Very difficult to arrange exchanges to leave the district. West Pilton probably has a worse reputation than Muirhouse. The Boswells are thought to be a better area. Lot of drunkards west of the Embassy. Comments about the bad drains and having to walk through mud to get to the school. One couple said the WC was cracked when they moved in and the corporation took 3 years to fix it, INTVER thinks this is an implausible story. They had undertaken home improvements such as new shelves, architraves, ball catches on the doors, screwing down floorboards to reduce noise. The buildings are too close together, they feel hemmed in. INTVER comments on the use of "some very working class pronunciation - ye ken, water with a glottal stop, hoose and bairns". Rents not fair but they\'d rather rent than buy. The corporation are not doing as many repairs as they used to, their firegrate was replaced after nine months but has broken again and they have to pay 17/11 for a new one. The outside of the houses were getting only two coats of paint instead of four and the windows have rusted. One of the INTVEEs has a mother in Gracemount but it is difficult to get there on the bus; the buses have a policy of not going into schemes because of the children and go round them instead. Prior to moving one couple had been paying £1 a week for a damp basement with mice. One INTVEE had heard that they were all Freemasons in the Corporation and you get anything with the right handshake. One INTVEE loved to walk but felt there was nothing to go out for here, just miles of houses. They like the beach but worry it will get overcrowded with more people moving in. Don\'t think it is particularly healthy for children here because of the damp and fumes from the gasworks. Male INTVEE thinks men are giving up their freedom but his wife disagrees and thinks women give up their freedom after marriage. they don\'t keep drink in the house, they have cocktail cabinets but keep knitting in them. Male INTVEE goes for a drink after work by himself; he doesn\'t like the Doo\'cot which he says is for regular drinkers.', '"IQ 67.

It is a three apartment house built in 1938. It could have more cupboard space, the heating arrangement is fine. The son sleeps in the living room. INTVER comments that the house has a more middle class appearance than other houses - a tile fireplace in the living room, decorated with contemporary paper, large carpet on the floor, large radiogramme and a television. They have recently installed an immersion heater for hot water during the summer but are pleased with the back boiler in the coal fire. INTVER comments that the kitchen is small but has a proper washing machine.Work at shipyards: Many men work until 70 year of age, during slack periods there is no discrimination against the older workers in fact it is usually the younger ones who are let go. The unions play no part in this. When you reach 65 they tell you that you can retire but don't encourage or discourage you to do so.Leisure: INTVEE turned on television and INTVER comments that they had come across this before as a form of hospitality. People don't go into each other's houses as much as they did in Leith. INTVER suggests this might be related to poverty and INTVEE's wife agrees - they were more dependant on each other in the past. INTVEE's son thinks there is a lack of sports facilities, he remembers the police chasing them for playing on plots of ground. The playing fields at Gypsy Brae are too small and there are no showers. Sighthill has a proper pavilion. Not much for younger people, they sometimes went to the Palais or the Cavendish for dancing at week-ends. They used to go to Divono's for table tennis but it was a rowdy place and there were often fights. INTVEE's wife likes to watch television. She is a member of the Baptist Church.Personal Finance: They pay 24/4d rent for the house which is cheaper than usual as they were classed as overcrowded to begin with. In 1938 it was 7/3d. Coal is a big expense, they get 2 and a half bags a week. Also pay for paraffin and electricity bill is usually £5 a quarter. They have never had more than one thing at a time on hire purchase. The salesmen are unscrupulous and make people get in more debt than they can afford.Shops: INTVEE's wife finds it cheaper to go to Leith to shop. She thinks there is lack a of playcentres and not enough open space for the children. However she also thinks the children were very destructive, she had been verbally abused when she told some children to stop throwing swing seats up and winding them over the top.Children: INTVEE's wife thinks children no longer know right from wrong and that difficulties arise because mothers and fathers are out working so much now. She thinks some parents give their children money for cigarettes. She thinks mothers don't care as much now, because they work they have money to spend and it is too easy to bribe children to go out or keep quiet. When she was 14 or 16 and went out to a dance she had to be back by 10pm. INTVEE's son thinks there has been a big change in gangs - they were bigger before and of mixed ages, now they are smaller and the older don't want to mix with the younger ones. He thinks television is making everyone want to act more grown-up. They do not think the area had a bad reputation.A kinship diagram is included.", '"This girl has asthma which Dr thinks is of psychoneurotic origin.

The Edinburgh way with funerals is much quieter, there\'s much more fuss at a Leith funeral; the men are plied with cake and food and the women just serve the men, they don\'t eat anything.

His father never hit them but there was a belt hanging on the wall. When he was younger he got spending money from his father and older brothers in exchange for small services.

May be married now."Relatives in survey: Grandmother 17.14, Cousin 17.2', 'INTVEE is a 62 year old widower who lives with his married son and daughter in law who are also present for some of the interview. Previously lived in Albert Street, Leith, where the children (all sons) slept in a bed recess off the main room. The family then moved to a four apartment house near Ferry Road. He left to live with his son on the death of his wife. INTVER wonders if the married couple are embarrassed having rows in front of the INTVEE but this is denied. The house has two bedrooms upstairs and a living room and kitchen downstairs. The kitchen opens off the living room and the garden accessed from the living room. The INTVER thinks the house unduly small - approx. 800 feet, but this was not a complaint of the family. They think the back boiler in the fire is efficient but annoying in the summer because they have to have a fire on to get hot water. INTVER comments that the house is furnished liberally but not expensively, furniture old but probably post-war.Leith: INTVER did not get the impression that the interviewee thought Leith was especially friendly although thinks women might have a different view. There were 14 tenants in the stair in Albert Street. He doesn\'t think people went in and out of each other\'s houses. He occasionally visited the pubs but thought if you had a wife you couldn\'t drink as much. He was unemployed for five years between the wars. INTVER notes that he is not particularly responsive to questions about his early life. They got their house near Ferry Road after being on the list for four years, had been very overcrowded with five children. The rent for their large house was 21/- a week. When he lived there alone children used to break in and steal from the gas meter. There seems to be less children in Drylaw so less trouble.Work: INTVEE no longer works due to ill health but had travelled to Leith every day which was cheap at first at 3d return but got more expensive. He would have liked to have stayed on to work after 65 and says this is common at the docks.Personal Finance: INTVEE receives a National Health pension and National Assistance. The former is due to increase but the latter due to decrease from 4/6d to 1/- which by the time he\'s paid his bus fare to collect it will only be worth 6d a week. He received a £7 grant for clothes with the help of Labour MP of Leith, Mr Hoy; they would not ask local MP for help as they are from Leith.Shops: INTVEE\'s daughter in law thinks the local shops add a penny or halfpenny on everything compared with Edinburgh and Leith. She usually shops at St Cuthbert\'s in Davidsons Mains.Leisure: INTVEE is not very active due to health, he watches some television. He likes detective plays but not very enthusiastic about it. INTVER comments on his general apathy and thinks he may be lonely but doesn\'t want to join an old age pensioner\'s club because he doesn\'t feel that old. INTVER asks him about his day and quotes him as saying "Oh they\'re very dull now. It\'s a very long day just looking out of the window. I just sit and I have my dinner and I have my tea, watch the television and go up to bed. That\'s all I do". INTVEE\'s son prefers the BBC to the ITV. At weekends he goes to Mackenzies,the pub in Davidson\'s Mains. INTVER asks him about the Doo-cot and quotes him as saying "Oh that place is a honkey-tonk place, it\'s in the middle of a scheme, that\'s the trouble".INTVER\'s thoughts: Interview does not give a satisfactory impression of life in the district. Main interviewee is lonely and may also feel a burden to his family. Thinks INTVEE\'s son is becoming very much urban middle class in his attitudes - preferring people to keep themselves to themselves, but his pub going is compensation for this.A kinship diagram is included.', "Copy of the University's submissions to the 1996 Research Assessment Exercise for Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Chemical Engineering, and Civil Engineering.", 'REPORTS TO EPC, COVERING NOTES, ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS', 'Correspondence relating to Chairs:Faculty of Arts, 1950-1960Faculty of Law, 1953-1958Faculty of Medicine, 1949-1958Faculty of Science, 1958-1959', 'Correspondence about the creation of the William P Baxendine Prize, and about whether the value of the Bowman MacLeod Bursary should be increased.', "Catalogus discipulorum qui studiorum suorum initio Bibliothecam Edinburgenam auxerunt'; a record of contributions paid by students at matriculation, 1653-1695, with details of books purchased and other disbursements for Library purposes to 1693.

They expected to get the keys to their new house in North Edinburgh in a few weeks time. They have been given no information about their new house or the area. INTVER thinks it is a neglect on the part of the corporation not to show the tenants their new home prior to moving. INTVER describes their location as, "in the middle of a group of older Georgian squares and streets now in a very decrepit condition. The site is an attractive one on a very steep slope running down to the Kings Park with Salisbury Crags towering just a few hundred yards away. The buildings must be nearly 200 years old and look as if they haven\'t been repaired for 100 of those. The paintwork is old and dirty, the stairs almost mouldering away, the plaster peeling away and dirt and newspapers accumulating in a most depressing way". INTVER goes on to say "when I came out and it was dark my ideas changed a little, the dirt and the filth and the decrepitness was not so apparent in the quiet gas light and the place seemed to come alive. There were little groups of people all over the place, a rather peculiar little fish and chip shop which looked like a front parlour, with a chip stove in the middle of it.....There seemed to be an intimacy which I think is going to be lost when these people move out to the estates". He describes the stair of INTVEE\'s flat as particularly gloomy and cavernous with very little paint left and smelling of disinfectant. They have lived there for 20 years renting from factors Gibbs in Nicholson Street. The rent is £1.9.8d monthly. The house is leaking and they have bowls down to collect the water. This is because people have been stealing the lead from the roof before the houses are demolished. The children cause pandemonium in the back yard on a Sunday which gets him down. A firm called Grants used to have a warehouse there but moved it because the kids kept breaking in. His wife is less keen to move and more attached to the centre of town than he is. He thinks the bad behaviour of children these days is linked to money - he knows some who get 15/- pocket money a week. He was careful to tell his daughters not to go standing about anywhere and keep to the main streets. They have a two-roomed flat which the INTVER thinks an odd construction; there\'s a main door then a little corridor with 2 single ends off it, then the INTVEE\'s front door leading off into a small hall with a kitchen/living room on one side and the bedroom on the other. INTVER describes it as a bit scruffy and dirty, the furniture worn out rexine and an air of poverty lightened by the expensive Pranal washing machine, modern gas cooker and 17" television, which was hired, and a small modern wireless. INTVEE complains about the water supply - he has one cold tap leading into the sink in the window, they heated their water in saucepans. There\'s no proper bathroom and INTVER supposed they must wash in the kitchen sink. INTVEE says he is domesticated and points out the curtains hanging up to dry on a line above their heads which he has washed. He also cooks and is quoted as saying "I have a system and I work it all out for days ahead, peel the tatties so that they\'re all ready for when I come in to cook". INTVER describes the other room as much more pleasant - a Sunday parlour with a put-up bed, clean and tidy, a well proportioned room with 2 largish windows, photographs and a small silver cup inscribed "To the world\'s best father". They pay £1.9.8d a month rent and will be paying 18/- a week for their new house. He is quoted as saying "I think it will be worth it, this place is really awful, I only earn £8.15/- a week so it isn\'t going to be easy". INTVER asks him about the move. His wife is worried about the shops but he thinks it will be better for them - fresher air, away from the hustle and bustle of traffic, more peace and quiet. He hoped they\'d get a ground floor so his wife wouldn\'t have the stairs. They get on well with the neighbours but don\'t blether. INTVER thinks he\'ll miss the pubs quite a bit and quotes him as saying "Sometimes I\'ll go to the Rat Trap - that\'s the Empire bar by the Surgeons Hall and find that there\'s a pint waiting for me". Asked about missing friends he says he\'ll still come up [into town] a bit and his wife has said "you\'re a Hearts supporter so that\'ll be alright, you\'ll soon meet people down there that are Hearts supporters as well".', 'Thesis presented by Stuart Bolton, MB Ch B for the degree of Doctor of Medicine and in competition for the Goodsir Fellowship.', 'Bound records giving basic details on appointments:Lectureships (1906-1924)University Assistants (1907-1922)Staff record cards (bound): Assistants, Lecturers, Readers (1926-1938)Additional Examiners (1893-1957)Preliminary Examiners (1951-1963)External Examiners (1965-1973)', '"This woman is mentally slow but clean and honest.

A committee was established to advise them of the best means of contributing to the study of animal breeding problems. Because at that time there were many well-known researchers working at the University of Edinburgh, such as James Cossar Ewart (1851-1933), professor of Natural History, physiologist Francis Hugh Adam Marshall (1878-1949) and Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire (1879-1915), lecturer in Genetics and Animal Breeding, it was evident that Edinburgh would become the centre for research in animal breeding. In 1913 the University of Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture Joint Committee on Research in Animal Breeding was formed. The Joint Committee submitted a proposal to the Commissioners and it was agreed that a scheme of work monitored by a scientific director be drawn up. With the advent of the First World War the plans had to be temporarily put to one side, particularly after the two potential candidates for the Institute Director were removed from the scene (Darbishire had died in 1915 and F.H.A Marshall had departed for Cambridge). It took a further four years before the project would finally get off the ground under the direction of Francis Albert Eley Crew (1886-1973). Crew, a charismatic man and qualified medic, whose childhood hobby of breeding bantams had led to a fascination with the study of heredity, held at that time an Assistantship in the Natural History Department of the University of Edinburgh. The centre that was founded was known initially as the Department of Research in Animal Breeding, although over the next few years it became known as the Department of Animal Genetics and, by around 1931, the Institute of Animal Genetics. The Department was managed by the Joint Committee and funded by the Development Commission, the Board of Agriculture for Scotland and the University of Edinburgh, although it would be some years before the Department became part of the University's structure. In 1924 the Department moved from its location in High School Yards out to the then new Chemistry Building on the King's Buildings campus, and also gained seven acres of grassland which provided an opportunity for maintaining a few farm animals under direct control for experimental purposes. A year later the Department was expanded thanks to various endowments and donations. These benefactions allowed for the creation of the Buchanan Chair of Animal Genetics in 1928 (to which Crew was appointed), the foundation of a new building on the Kings Buildings site (which opened in 1930), as well as providing additional funds for research. A further result was that the Joint Committee was disbanded and the Department became an integral part of the University with a new Animal Breeding Committee advising on the management of the Department. Under Crew's leadership, research in the fields of reproductive physiology and genetics was encouraged to develop side by side as a facet of scientific animal breeding. In 1929 Crew and Bertold Wiesner (1901-1972) created a Pregancy Diagnosis Laboratory, which tested samples sent by medical practitioners or private individuals from all over the UK. This Laboratory was the first of its kind in Britain, and ultimately was to transfer to the Usher Institute with Crew. Professor Crew was also successful in securing the Institute as the location for the Imperial (later the Commonwealth) Bureau of Animal Genetics, which was established in 1930 to disseminate information through reviews and bibliographies, with Animal Breeding Abstracts being first published in 1933. The pre-war period concluded with the staging of the 7th International Congress of Genetics in Edinburgh in September 1939 which was unfortunately curtailed by the outbreak of war. Many of the staff at the Institute, including Crew, were immediately called up for war service and the Institute was placed in the charge of Alan William Greenwood (1897-1981), head of the Poultry Section. After the war, Professor Crew returned to the University of Edinburgh, but not to the field of genetics, having accepted the Chair of Public Health and Social Medicine. In 1945 the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) formed the National Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation (NABGRO, later ABGRO, then ABRO), and it was decided that the genetics laboratory would be located within the Institute (the overall head, R.G White, was based in Wales). Conrad Hal Waddington (1905-1975) was appointed head of the genetics section and also took up the University's Buchanan Chair of Animal Genetics. Alan Greenwood, who had run the Institute during Crew's absence, left to become the first Director of the Poultry Research Centre in 1947. Following the retirement of Robert G. White as Director of ABGRO in 1950, Hugh P Donald (1908-1989) was appointed co-director with Waddington, each in charge of one section of the Institute; Animal Breeding and Animal Genetics respectively. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the head of the Genetics Section was not employed by the ARC but by the University of Edinburgh. This was rectified in 1951 when Donald was appointed Director of the renamed Animal Breeding Research Organisation (ABRO), while the Animal Genetics Section under Waddington became a separate ARC funded group within the University Department. Under this arrangement, the 'Institute of Animal Genetics' passed out of existence in its previous format, although the name was retained to denote the building and became a by-word for the bodies it contained. It was eventually designated the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics in 1957. In 1968, Waddington took up the position of Einstein Professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the administration of the Unit was taken over by the Deputy Director, Douglas Scott Falconer, who would later take over as Director. The Unit continued until Falconer's retirement in 1980 when it was disbanded. The Genetics Building was renamed the Crew Building and is currently home to the University's School of GeoSciences.", 'For most of its history, academic structure the University of Edinburgh was managed by Faculties. From 2002, the structure of the university changed, with 3 new Colleges each overseeing various Schools.', "The Joint Biotechnology Unit between Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt Universities was proposed 'to undertake research and development in areas where the experience and expertise of those concerned is complementary.

It functioned as a loosely knit federation of those departments involved in teaching biological subjects. The Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology participated in its Planning and Policy Group and Steering Committee.', "Andrew Duncan senior (1744-1828) was the first in Britain to lecture in forensic medicine, beginning in 1789. In 1807, the University of Edinburgh was the first in the country to establish a Chair of Medical Jurisprudence. The full title was 'Regius Chair of Medical Jurisprudence and Medical Police'. Andrew Duncan junior (1773-1832) was the first to hold the post. He was succeeded by William Pultney Allison (1790-1859), who held the Chair 1820-1821. On the appointment of Robert Christison (1797-1882) in 1822, the Chair was moved from the Faculty of Law to the Faculty of Medicine. He was succeeded in 1832 by Thomas Stewart Traill (1781-1862). In turn he was succeeded, in 1862, by Andrew Douglas Maclagan (1812-1900). Henry Duncan Littlejohn was appointed to the then Chair of Forensic Medicine and Public Health in 1897. However the University established a separate Chair in Public Health the following year, that element was removed from Littlejohn's immediate remit and became the responsibility of Charles Hunter Stewart, the first Professor of Public Health. The Institute of Public Health was established 3 years later. In 1906, Henry Harvey Littlejohn (1862-1927) succeeded his father, holding the post until his death in 1927. In 1906 he also became Police Surgeon in Edinburgh. The next incumbent was Sydney Alfred Smith (1883-1969), who had previously been an assistant under Henry Harvey Littlejohn and also frequently acted as a medical expert in court. He succeeded in 1928 and held the post until 1953 when he was was succeeded by John Kenyon Mason.", 'In 1921, the local authorities of Newcastle asked Godfrey Thomson to design a test which would make selection a more fair process. They provided bursaries for secondary school education, and were concerned by a lack of applicants from rural backgrounds. Thomson aimed to create a test which allowed children to demonstrate their native wit or innate intelligence, rather than past learning, since rural children were often absent from school. This resulted in the Northumberland Mental Tests.', 'The early years of the Institute of Clinical and Molecular Biology from ( 1990) saw it engaged in negotiation over and planning the physical space allocated to the various parts of the new body and their specific activities within the buildings at their disposal.', 'The Medical Research Council funded a number of students on courses with the Department of Molecular Biology.', 'The history of student administration is complex. Today these affairs are handled by the University Registry but, in earlier periods, they were handled elsewhere. Prior to 1791 each professor matriculated his own class. Students often attended more than one class. In 1791 and up until 1810, the students attending the literary and philosophical classes enrolled themselves in one continuous list, as did also the students attending the Scots and civil law classes. Medical students, previous to 1763, matriculated with each professor they attended. From 1810 all medical students were annually enrolled in one alphabetical list. From 1811 all the students annually enrolled themselves in one continued list and describe themselves as literary, medical or law students. Previous to this date, the total number of the literary and philosophical students that have matriculated cannot be accurately known, from the circumstance of the greater number of them attending more than one class in the same session. From about the 1820s students were also matriculated according to faculty. The matriculation of students was not so strictly enforced before 1809, so numbers are probably less than students who attended the College. In 1812 it was stated that every student must provide himself with a matriculation ticket, for which the fee was 10 shillings. Students at the time could enrol between 10am and 3pm in the Library which seems to have carried out this part of the matriculation process. It also stated that the entering of a name in the matriculation album was the only legal record of attendance in the University. Matriculation involved a different process for medical students. As part of the process of matriculation a solemn promise of obedience and good behaviour was taken called a Sponsio Academia and is annually prefixed to the list of students who matriculate or enrol themselves each year in the album. It appears that the Sponsio had previously been taken in the Great Hall of the College, accompanied by an exhortation from the principal. The Sponsio then appears to have been part of signing the matriculation album prefixed to the annual lists of students from 1762. The Sponsio did not involve any religious test.', "The University Library was begun in 1580 by a donation of books by Clement Littil, an Edinburgh advocate and commissary. He left his theological books to Edinburgh and its Kirk and these were subsequently steered into the 'Town's College' by his brother in 1584. The library collections were subsequently augmented by gifts and donations. Two major gifts, from William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585-1649) in the 1620s and 1630s, and one more major bequest, from a former Keeper of the Library, the Revd James Nairn (1629-1678) in 1678, helped establish the Library as a working collection. It had also become customary for students to make a gift of money or books at their graduation. In the mid seventeenth century, students were encouraged to contribute to the Library at matriculation as well as graduation. Books were also received from other sources. In 1710, the Copyright Act entitled the four Scottish Universities to receive a copy of every book registered at Stationers' Hall. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Library had around 11,000 volumes. This entitlement was discontinued in 1837 and replaced by an annual payment from the Treasury. The Library was a central source for the printed materials. However 1724 saw the appearance of what might be considered the first departmental library. The Professor of Natural History and his students set up a 'physiological library'. Throughout the eighteenth century, the University Library was controlled by the Town Council and this was often the cause of tension between the College and the Council. Principal William Robertson (1721-1793) set about re-organising the Library, dividing it into a general branch and a medical branch. He also raised substantial funds for the library which he administered himself to ensure that the money was spent wisely. During this time, students could borrow a book on depositing a sum equal to the value of the book. Intellectual access to the expanding collection of books was facilitated by the creation of catalogues. Throughout the life of the Library, these have taken a number of forms. In 1637, Robert Lumsden completed the first press catalogue which include details of the 2410 volumes held at that time. This catalogue was maintained up to 1641. A four volume catalogue was prepared by Duke Gordon in 1755 and this remained the Library's main finding aid for the next 50 years. In 1809, a new alphabetical catalogue was prepared. This was followed in 1824 by a 17 volume catalogue prepared by J. Morrison, a special assistant in the Library. The steady increase in the size of the collection and the increased demand placed on it by the expanding student body meant that new accommodation had to be found. The Library was provided with specific accommodation in 1617 and a new Library building was founded in 1642. In 1827, the books were transferred to the completed Adam-Playfair building now known as Old College. This building provided elegant accommodation for the storage of the collections and the students. However, the increasing pressures of the storage and user demand meant that new solutions to the problem had to be found. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of ad hoc solutions were adopted, any available space was employed for books or readers. The idea of a new library building had been considered as early as 1944 and various sites were examined. In 1949, the Library Committee started to look into what might be required for an entirely new building. The process was slow and it wasn't until 1967 that the new Library Building at George Square was opened. Edinburgh University Library now forms part of the Information Services Group.", "The Department of Molecular Biology received regular information regarding the management of The Medical Research Council as well as records of its early activities in molecular genetics.

The Committee, which met twice a year, originally included representatives from the University of Edinburgh (including the Professor of Animal Genetics); the Edinburgh and East Scotland College of Agriculture; the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland. Alexander Miles served as Convener of the Committee from 1928 until 1947. The Committee advised the University Court on the research, financial and administrative matters of the Animal Breeding Research Department.', "The Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947 tested almost every child born in 1921 and 1936 respectively attending school in Scotland. The first Scottish Mental Survey, organised and undertaken by the Scottish Council for Research in Education, was undertaken as part of Scotland's contribution to the International Examinations Inquiry, with the aim of describing the mental abilities of Scottish children. For this purpose, the Moray House Test No. 12 was chosen, and 87, 498 children were given the test on June 1, 1932. By the 1940s, debate was rife regarding the perceived differential birth rate, and the Royal Commission on Population was formed to investigate this, assisted by the Population Investigation Committee (PIC), and the Eugenics Society, who were both concerned that the nations' intelligence levels were lowering as a direct result of professional people having less children than those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The purpose of the second Scottish Mental Survey, therefore, was to enable comparison with the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey. There were 70,805 participants in the second Scottish Mental Survey, which again used a test designed by Thomson and his colleagues, and the results showed a slight improvement in the nation's intelligence.", "This trophy, affectionately known as 'the Pigs' Cup', was awarded to Edinburgh's Institute of Animal Genetics in 1933 by the Scottish National Fat Stock Club. In later years, the Cup was used as the annual prize in cricket matches between staff and students in the Department.", 'The Department of Molecular Biology kept .', "Demonstrators in Anatomy were formally recognised as 'Professors by the' Town Coucil in 1705. In 1720 Alexander Monro (primus) was given a life appointment as Professor of Anatomy. Two further generations of Alexander Monros followed. This 'dynastic succession' ceased with the appointment of John Goodsir in 1846. He in turn was succeeded by Sir William Turner in 1867, who remained in post until 1903, when he became Principal of the University. The Chair was then helf by Daniel John Cunningham from 1903, Arthur Robinson from 1909, James Coupar Brash from 1931 and George John Romanes from 1954 to 1984. Teaching in the 18th century would have been heavily based around the Anatomy Theatre which was built in 1764 for Monro (secundus). In 1880 the department moved to purpose-built accomodation within the New Medical Buildings in Teviot Row.", 'The Department of Molecular Biology participated in the establishment of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory by the European Molecular Biology Organisation.

In 1922 a University Diploma replaced the School Diploma and in 1928 the School was fully transferred to the University becoming the Department of Social Study and Training. Nora Milnes who had been Director of the School continued in her post until she was succeeded by Marjorie Brown in 1951, who herself retired in 1964. During this time the department began offering Certificates in Psychiatric Social Work, Medical Social Work and Child Care, enabling students to specialise in a particular field. The Department became known as the Department of Social Administration on the appointment of John Spencer as Chair in 1967, having had Dr Molly Gregor and Megan Brown as Directors in the interim period. A generic Diploma in Social Work was offered from 1970 replacing all previous Certificates and Diplomas. A Masters in Social Work has been offered since 1990.', 'This survey was designed to be the first of its kind within Britain, mimicking those undertaken across Western Europe and the U.S.A. By choosing the Dumfriesshire area as a sample representative of rural communities across Britain, this project attempted to survey the incidence of perceived mental abnormalities within the population. Stemming from eugenicist anxieties about a farming population in numerical, moral, and medical decline, it hoped to identify casual hereditary and social factors in order to prevent, contain, and cure mental illness. To do so, a number of patients previously admitted to the Crichton Royal were followed up by a psychiatric social worker, and questioned. Taking into account the opinions of respected authorities in the local area, the social worker attempted to again an idea of subjects\' mental health issues, familial relationships, and social conditions.In 1946 the Dumfries and Galloway Development Association carried out a pilot survey in the three Solway Counties (Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtownshire) to find out why people were leaving the countryside and while people wished to remain in rural areas. This survey though psychologically sound vis a vis certain sections of the community was not on a scientific sampling basis so at the suggestion of Dr. Mayer-Gross of the Crichton Royal, who had carried out a psychiatric survey in Dumfriesshire, it was thought that more definite information was required as to this subject as to which so many people had so many different opinions. Accordingly the Secretary of State was approached with a view to the Social Survey carrying out on a scientific basis. Eventually in 1947 after preparatory field work by the Department of Health carried out by the Misses Thomson and Jones, assisted possibly by a conference with members of the Dumfries and Galloway Department Association, the Survey was initiated under the auspices of the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture at St. Andrews House.It was proposed that the last 500 admissions from the area could be taken as a suitable nucleus from which the survey could be started, or if advisable to avoid the war years, all admissions between 1930 and 1935. Discharged cases would be followed up, the families of those still in hospital visited by Psychiatric Social Worker.Additional persons were identified through speaking to professionals in each parish. District nurses were to be asked for all chronic invalids without marked physical disabilities. Doctors to be asked about patients considered to be psychiatric. The Labour Exchange was to provide information on those not attending the doctor but with a limited capacity for work due to suspected neurosis. Policeman were to be asked for names of all troublesome people in the district, "including alcoholics, idlers, shirkers ne\'er do wells and gamblers. They should be asked about the most untrustworthy people in the district which may lead to the assessment of pathological liars and swindlers. Generally speaking everybody who gets into trouble with the police or the courts must be suspected of being abnormal with the exception of traffic offences, alcoholic excesses and other petty and single offences. The police have also probably the best knowledge of suicidal attempts and sexual offences".5105 persons were finally included, being 9 percent of the total population.Source: Administrative files EUA IN1/ACU/S2/17', "The Department of Molecular Biology was founded in the University of Edinburgh in October 1965 by Martin R Pollock, Head of the Division of Microbial Physiology, and William Hayes, Director of the MRC Microbial Genetics Research Unit. Pollock and Hayes had realised that the fields of biochemistry and molecular genetics had converged to the extent that a new department combining them would be able to make significant contributions to the field. Several Universities were considered and Edinburgh eventually chosen. They were initially based in the biophysics unit but moved into the Darwin Building in 1968. At this point, the staff of the MRC Microbial Genetics Research Unit which had been based in London moved into the department. The first PhD students joined in 1965, third year courses began in 1968 and the first honours courses began in 1969. The department's policy was that their honours students should go elsewhere to study for a PhD. The department was involved in a lot of research which included recognition of bidirectional transcription of DNA in E. Coli, progress in the elucidation of the genetics, physiology and structure of factors responsible for antibiotic resistance in bacteria, the first bacteriophage vectors for recombinant DNA technology and their application to the cloning and manipulation of genes from any organism, the application of the methods of Molecular Biology to explore the possibilities of malaria vaccines and the production of the first artifical vaccine for Hepatitis B. These were produced by Ken Murray and the proceeds partly used to found The Darwin Trust. The Darwin Trust founded the Biocomputing Research Unit to enable the department to cope with the enormous expansion in the flow of information regarding amino acid and the nucleotide sequences that underpin all genome projects and also founded a unified Science Library. Other departments dealing with different aspects of biology were scattered across the university and plans were made to pull these strands together. In 1990 the department ceased in that form and became part of the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology.", 'The Department of Forestry & Natural Resources shared the same building as the Department of Molecular Biology.', 'Two hundred and seventeen families were approached to produce a yield of 180 interviews.

We sought therefore to investigate the social affiliations of the family (neighbourliness, membership of local bodies, use of services, kinship relations, etc) and to relate these to the origins and previous movements of families, to their consitution and to the features of the district - its age, ownership and housing type.""Four clusters of streets were chosen, hence the name of the study. Two were post-war, built between 1952 and 1959, and two were pre-war. One of each pair consisted of Corporation-owned tenemented houses, the other of owner-occupied detached, semi-detached or terraced housing. Each area contained between 300 and 500 houses and in choosing them an attempt was made to form relatively homogenous groups."Taken from "Social Environment in Suburban Edinburgh", Hutton, Geoffrey, 1975, pp7.4-7.5.

Recent restructuring in the University (2002) abolished faculties and the School is now a part of the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine. Since 1962, the Faculty has operated on two sites, at Summerhall and at the Easter Bush Veterinary Centre, near Roslin, six miles south of Edinburgh. This split was rendered necessary because of the growing difficulty of obtaining large animal clinical material at Summerhall. Two site operation means that each of the undergraduate years can be exposed to work with farm animals and horses in an appropriate rural setting. Sited within the University's developing Technopole, the Easter Bush Veterinary Centre forms part of one of the most comprehensive aggregations of rural and agricultural research institutes in the world.", "A Faculty of Laws was established at Edinburgh Universitynn in 1707 by the creation of a Regius Professorship of Public Law. The Faculty was further established during the first quarter of the eighteenth century. Previous to this, many scholars intent on training in law had chosen to go to known centres of learning such as Utrecht, Leydne, Groningen or Halle. There had been previous attempt to establish a school of Law in Edinburgh. The first was as part of Bishop Reid's bequest ( 1558) for the creation of a College of Arts and Law; the second was an attempt by the College of Justice to establish a Professorship of Laws in 1590. Neither of these two attempts succeeded. In 1710, Edinburgh Town Councilnn appointed James Craig Professor of Civil Law and assigned a classroom for teaching purposes. His appointment was not salaried until 1716 when an Act of Parliament provided for a tax on ale and beer sold in the City of Edinburgh. The revenues thus raised where to be used to settle a salary on the Professor of Law in the University of Edinburgh. An Act of 1722 required the revenues to provide for the salary of the renamed Professor of Civil Law, as well as a Professorship of universal Civil history and Greek and Roman Antiquities. The Act also provided for a Professor of Scots Law. Throughout the eighteenth century the Faculty consisted of three Professors - Public, Civil and Municipal Law. There was also a Professor of History. Teaching in Public Law appears to have been intermittent with the Chair vacant between 1831-1862, however, it was revived by an Act of Parliament in 1858.", "In 1806, a Chair in Music was created in the University of Edinburgh. General John Reid (1721-1807) had made a 'generous' provision in his will for a 'Professorship of Music in the College and University of Edinburgh'. However, it was not until 1839 that John Thomson was appointed as the Reid Professor of Music. This meant that Edinburgh was the first British university (after Oxford and Cambridge) to have a permanent Chair in the subject. In 1860, the Reid School of Music in Teviot Place was built as a classroom and concert hall. In 1891, new Ordinances provided for 'Regulations for Degrees in Music'. In 1894, this was approved by Parliament and the Music Faculty now exisited in its own right. Previously, the Reid Chair came under the aegis of the Faculty of Arts. In 1967, the Faculty moved to Alison House in Nicolson Square.", 'The tests were initially called Moray House Intelligence Tests (M.H.T.), but were later changed to Moray House Verbal Reasoning Tests (with the abbreviation M.H.T. remaining).', 'One volume was donated by Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson to the department of education, one was donated by Professor D J Finley to the Education Library (research unit) in 1970.', 'The Department of Molecular Biology monitored the employment opportunities in the field of molecular biology and communicated with other institutions and commercial organisations.', 'The issue of safety was dealt with within guidelines laid down across the University of Edinburgh as a whole and according to guidelines and legislation which applied to types of activities the Department of Molecular Biology was involved in.', 'From the early 17th century, the governing body of the University of Edinburgh was the Senatus Academicus. By Act of Parliament this was transferred to the University Court in 1889. The Court had come into existence following the Act of 1858 but from 1889 it became a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The current positions of Rector, Chancellor and Principal & Vice Chancellor also stem from the 1858 Act, as does the General Council which elects the Chancellor and four Assessors on the Court. The Curators of Patronage continue the link between the university and the city, though their powers are now largely formal.', "The 'Chair of Physik and Chymistry' was established in 1713, with James Crawford (1682-1731) as first professor. A Chair of Chemistry at Cambridge predated Edinburgh by a decade. Oxford was not to have one until the 19th century. Under Andrew Plummer (1697-1756) and John Innes (d1773) the couse was offered as being taught 'according to the Method of the celebrated Herman Boerhaave, at Leyden'. The College Physik Garden was also well utilised. Amongst the students of this period was James Hutton (1726-1797) who went on to be recognised as one of science's great innovators and a founder member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. William Cullen (1710-1790) became joint professor with Plummer in 1755 and then third professor the following year. He developed the teaching mechanisms within the department, moving away from that of Boerhaave, developing the teaching laboratory and the application of chemistry to industry. His lectures were also in English rather than Latin. Cullen's successor was Joseph Black (1728-1799). He had assisted Cullen earlier in Glasgow. Black was the discoverer of 'fixed air' (carbon dioxide), a correspondent of Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794) and close friend of James Watt (1736-1819). Black's research gave way to his development of teaching at Edinburgh. He successfully used practical demonstrations during lectures and his class sizes exceeded 200. His successor had also been his student. Thomas Charles Hope (1866-1844) became fifth professor of Chemistry and Chemical Pharmacy in 1795. His lecturing skills led him to become the 'most popular teacher of chemistry in Britain'. Lecture attendances rose from 293 in 1799 to 559 in 1823. He kept his lectures up to date and was also the first to expound Lavoisier's ideas in Britain. William Gregory (1803-1858) became sixth professor in 1844 amidst unprecedented competition for the post. This was the first time that the position was solely the Chair of Chemistry. During his term he published his textbook Outlines of Chemistry, (1845). His successor was one of the previously unsuccessful candidates (Sir) Lyon Playfair (1818-1898), who held the post until he was elected MP for the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews in 1869. Alexander Crum Brown (1838-1922) succeeded to the post, shortly after the BSc and DSc degrees had been established. His major contribution to chemistry was the development of the graphical illustration of chemical formulae. During his term he was involved in the development of the Medical School building, into which department he moved. The period also saw the introduction of salaries and the appointment of lecturers. Crum Brown also became part of the newly created Faculty of Science in 1893 (although the chemistry chair remained within the Faculty of Medicine). (Sir) James Walker (1863-1935), formerly private assistant to Crum Brown, was his successor. He found laboratory resources stretched but the outbreak of the First World War prevented any immediate resolution. The war saw Walker using graduates, students and staff in production of TNT. The immediate post-war period saw the transfer of chemistry to the Faculty of Science and the physical move to the new King's Buildings campus. The four year BSc degree in Chemistry was introduced in 1921 and a year later the degree in Technical Chemistry was introduced in conjunction with Heriot-Watt College. The latter to develop into the Department of Chemical Engineering by 1960. Former Edinburgh graduate James Kendall (1889-1978) became tenth professor in 1928. This was a period of diverse research work. Lecturers included future Nobel Prize winner Heinrich Wieland (1877-1957) and (Sir) Edmund Langley Hirst (1898-1975) joined the department, appointed to the new Forbes Chair of Organic Chemistry. The department increasingly became a source of advice to government and industry and also saw its medical dimension moved to the Department of Biochemistry (initially the Department of Chemistry Relating to Medicine). Hirst succeeded Kendall as head of department in 1959, with Tom L Cottrell (1923-1973) becoming eleventh chair. The latter was a former Edinburgh graduate who had done extensive research work within the industrial sector. These research skills were developed into 'a flourishing research school in physical chemistry' at Edinburgh. He published extensively and he set up the first British group to invesigate molecular beams. The 1960s saw Charles Kemball (1923-:) become twelfth professor and the appointments of Elizabeth Ebsworth (1933-:) to the new Crum Brown Chair of Chemistry, and Neil Campbell (1903-:) to a Personal Chair of Chemistry. All gained large degrees of professional recognition for their research work and publications. In 1969, (Sir) John IG Cadogan (1930-:), amongst who's innovations was the introduction of Evironmental Chemistry to Edinburgh, was appointed to the Forbes Chair, a position he held for a decade during which time the department gained a £92,500 award to fund a Unit for High Speed Liquid Chromatography. John Knox (1927-:) was appointed to the position of director of the unit and to a Personal Chair in Physical Chemistry. Robert Donovan (1941-:), internationally acclaimed for work on spectroscopy and photochemical studies, was appointed to a Personal Chair in Physical Chemistry in 1979 and took over as thirteenth professor in 1986. His research group secured the necessary funding to acquire for the department laser equipment which met the current highest international standards. Sufficient funding was also acquired to purchase a Nuclear Magetic Response (NMR) spectrometer. Grants were also obtained from the Science (and Engineering) Research Council for research and upgrading equipment. In 1980 Alistair Ian Scott (1928-:) was appointed to the Forbes Chair and in 1984 Robert Ramage (1934-:) was appointed to the same. Ramage's interests in the field of antibiotics were reflected in developing work in biological sciences. A research grant of £119,000 was achieved from the Science and Engineering Research Council for collagen research and of £90,000 for the Vitamin Research Group. There was also support from the Wellcome Trust for work on DNA. In 1989 David WH Rankin (1945-:), already a research fellow within the department, was appointed to a Personal Chair in Structural Chemistry and devoloped the NMR Unit.", 'Scholarly articles were published by many staff members of the Department of Molecular Biology, including Martin Rivers Pollock, and Richard Penry Ambler. Reprints of these were kept by the department.', 'The Committee of Unit Directors of the Medical Research Council was formed as a relatively informal and flexible body consisting of a number of Directors drawn from MRC units. It met approximately once every academic term.', "Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire was appointed to the Lectureship in Genetics at the University of Edinburgh in 1911. In his research, Darbishire argued for an approach which united Mendelian and biometric thinking to fully comprehend the study of heredity, and in 1909 he repeated one of Mendel's classic pea-crossing experiments. Darbishire's promising career was cut short in 1915 when he died of meningitis in an army training camp.", 'In 1967 a working party was created within the Faculty of Science to consider the structure of the BSc degree.', 'The Department of Molecular Biology participated in the activities of the International Cell Research Organisation which saw cell and molecular biology as having a priority for scientific cooperation internationally.', 'The Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology was formed in 1990. Prior to that the subject of biology had been scattered through seven different departments of the University of Edinburgh and this arrangement was viewed as detremental to both teaching and the furthering of research. The Department of Molecular Biology was joined with the departments of Botany, Microbiology and parts of both Zoology and Genetics, securing additional funding from organisations including the Royal Society, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.', 'Lists for various chemistry classes and lectures were kept by individual professors, such as William Cullen and Thomas Charles Hope and/or by the department itself.', 'The Godfrey Thomson lectures were held annually in memory of Godfrey Thomson, and their publication was arranged and funded by the Chairman of Trustees for the Godfrey Thomson Unit.', 'Although the Medical School can trace its origins back to the barber surgeons of Edinburgh in the early part of the 16th century, the Faculty of Medicine did not gain formal recognition within the University until 1726. During the 18th and much of the 19th centuries, Edinburgh was regarded as the leading medical centre in Europe and up to the present day can claim many distinguished medical practitioners and scientists among its alumni and staff. The academic departments in the Faculty of Medicine were distributed through the Medical School Buildings and the main teaching hospitals in the city of Edinburgh. University reorganisation in 2002 saw the Faculty of Medicine become part of the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine.', 'A Conference on University Assessment Procedures was held in 1970 to look at the role of examinations and other assesment procedures within the Faculty of Science.', 'Charles Mackie was first Professor of Universal Civil History and Antiquities at the University of Edinburgh, from 1719.', "In 1929 and 1930, T.B. Macaulay made endowments for the benefit of the Institute of Animal Genetics. The largest of these endowments allowed for the provision of the Buchanan Chair of Animal Genetics and the support of various research staff. Smaller amounts of money enabled the support of 'Macaulay Fellows' (mainly post-doctoral students or established scientists on sabbatical).", 'Waddington was appointed Director of the National Animal Breeding and Research Organisation (NABGRO, later ABRO) as well as to the Buchanan Chair in Genetics in 1946, and moved into the Institute of Animal Genetics building in 1947.

These were completed in 1960 and opened at a ceremony presided over by Sir Henry Dale, Chairman of the Trust.', 'The Faculty of Science at the University of Edinburgh was instituted under the terms of Ordinance No 31 of the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. Prior to this the teaching and conferring of degrees in scientific subjects was split between the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Medicine, and from 1864 had been overseen by the Science Degrees Committee. A Department of Science was still maintained in the Faculty of Arts for some time after the creation of the Faculty of Science in 1893. Some of the subjects taught at this time under the new faculty included natural history, anatomy, geology, agriculture and rural economy, natural philosophy, chemistry, botany, physiology and engineering. From 1920 the Faculty of Science was housed in the newly built Kings Buildings. In 1934 the Royal Dick School of Veterinary Studies was affiliated to the University of Edinburgh. In 1951 the School became a constituent part of the University within the Faculty of Medicine. In 1964 the Professor of Veterinary Hygiene and Preventive Medicine was admitted to membership of the Faculty of Science prior to the creation of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. As the Faculty grew departments were organised into divisions within the Faculty, such as the Division of Biological Sciences. Science libraries were also developed within the University. In February 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering.', 'These publications were collected by the Godfrey Thomson Unit for research purposes and reference.', "The University Library was begun in 1580 by a donation of books by Clement Littil, an Edinburgh advocate and commissary. He left his theological books to Edinburgh and its Kirk and these were subsequently steered into the 'Town's College' by his brother in 1584. The library collections were subsequently augmented by gifts and donations. Two major gifts, from William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585-1649) in the 1620s and 1630s, and one more major bequest, from a former Keeper of the Library, the Rev. James Nairn (1629-1678) in 1678, helped establish the Library as a working collection. It had also become customary for students to make a gift of money or books at their graduation. In the mid seventeenth century, students were encouraged to contribute to the Library at matriculation as well as graduation. Books were also received from other sources. In 1710, the Copyright Act entitled the four Scottish Universities to receive a copy of every book registered at Stationers' Hall. This entitlement lasted until 1837. The Committee of Curators was formed in 1807, initially numbering twelve of those professors willing to undertake such duties and rotated with four retiring annually. In 1842 the number of Curators was reduced to six. Its role was to act as a regulator to the Library, including sanctioning the purchase of new books. In 1847, the Principal became an ex-officio Curator. The Book Purchase Sub-committee was established in 1895 to which the Librarian had to report regularly on expediture and available funds. It selected and recommended books for purchase for approval at the full Library Committee. By the 1930s recommendation methods also came from 'suggestion forms', available to Library and academic staff, or via the suggestions book which was kept at the main counter of the Library.", 'The Faculty of Science were looking to coordinate electron microscope facilities and involved members of the departments including Chemistry, Botany, Molecular Biology and Zoology. A working group/party was established to investigate the purchase of an electron microscope for the department and recommended a specific brand and model. Correspondence on the matter was conducted within and outwith the department and included the securing of the necessary funds.', 'The Science Degrees Committee was set up in 1864 to regulate the study of scientific subjects in the University of Edinburgh. From the beginning of the University, Science subjects had been studied, but had been regulated in the Faculty of Arts and later the Faculty of Medicine. It was set up after a proposal by Sir Lyon Playfair in 1863 that a committee be set up to consider the provision of a Degree in Science. In 1864 the committee made its first report. The new degrees of Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Science were first offered in the Academic year 1864-1865 in Physical and Natural Science, Mental Science and Philology. The Science Degrees Committee oversaw the administration of these degrees until 1893 when the Faculty of Science was instituted. The Committee was disbanded and the Faculty of Science took over its responsibilities.', 'The Division of Biological Sciences was estabished in 1990 and included the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology. The latter participated in the Working and Action Group of the former and dealt with issues including administration, teaching and finance.', "The Farm Sub-Committee was appointed by the Animal Breeding Committee on 23 October 1929, following a grant of £5,000 from Canadian financer T.B Macaulay to purchase an experimental farm (this was shortly to be established at Shothead Farm, Balerno).

Following the recommendations of a Joint Committee of Court and Senatus (set up by Sir Richard Lodge in 1916), the position of University Secretary was established. It took over from the Secretaries of Court and Senatus and also oversaw the general secretarial business of the University.', "A minibus service was used to connect the main campus to King's Buildings. The Faculty of Science had a coordinating role, circulating information and tickets to departments.", 'The Genetic Manipulation Advisory Group was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1976 to look at research and work involving genetic manipulation.

Members of the Department of Molecular Biology were involved in dialogue between the university and the committee.', "The Godfrey Thomson Unit takes its names from Sir Godfrey H. Thomson (1881-1955), who served as both Professor of Education at the University of Edinburgh and Director of Studies at Moray House Training College between 1925-1951. The Unit is best known for production of the Moray House Tests, assessment tests administered to students throughout the UK, largely in England. Moray House Tests were also used in the Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1937. Godfrey Thomson began his involvement in intelligence assessment while Chair of Education at Armstrong College, Newcastle, when he was asked by the Northumberland Authority to develop the first British group intelligence tests for use in the Special Place examination. Devised by Thomson in 1921, the Northumberland Mental Tests were administered to a large number of eleven year old children who were candidates for free places in secondary schools, and are the precursor to the Moray House Tests. In 1925 Thomson was appointed as both Professor of Education at the University of Edinburgh and Director of Studies at Moray House Training College, stating that he would see his university and college duties merge without 'an over-nice discrimination between the two halves'. Thomson continued his studies in statistics and psychometrics in Edinburgh, and soon established a test construction and research unit. Staffed by members of the of the University of Edinburgh Education Department, the unit was located in Room 70 in the Moray House College building now known as Paterson's Land. Thus, the unit came to be known as 'Room 70' and the tests were called the Moray House Tests. The tests primarily fall into three major categories: Verbal Reasoning (M.H.T..), English (M.H.E.) and Mathematics (M.H.M.). By 1948 Moray House Tests were administered to two out of three British children and were used and recognised throughout the world. In 1949 one and a quarter million Moray House Tests were sold, making the University the largest supplier of tests in Europe. Royalties earned from test sales were transferred into a research fund, later registered as the Godfrey Thomson Research Fund, which was established by Thomson to support continued educational research and assessment. In particular, money was invested into improving the tests, making them as fair as possible. Established in a formal basis in 1940 when a Deed of Trust was drawn up between Thomson and the University, the Fund was later administered by trustees, with the Professor of Education as Chairman and the Principal of Moray House College of Education as Vice-Chairman. In addition to test royalties, the fund also earned income from fees paid by county Education Committees for the analysing, collating, and assessing of the results from Moray Houses Tests administered to students. Upon Thomson's retirement in 1951, the University and College posts were once again disassociated, with John Pilley taking over Professor of Education, University of Edinburgh, while Dr. W.B Inglis became the new Director of Studies at Moray House. However, the University Department of Education, including the Room 70 research unit, continued to be accommodated at Moray House. In September 1952 the unit relocated to Room 76, although it retained the moniker Room 70. At this time the unit employed eight staff members, six of which were paid through the Thomson Research Fund. In 1965 the Room 70 unit formally became Godfrey Thomson Unit for Academic Assessment (University of Edinburgh). By the late 1960's the unit was lead by A.E.G. Pilliner and was no longer based at Moray House, instead occupying premises at Buccleuch Place, where it would remain into the 1990s.", 'A Constitution and Structure Committee was set up by the Court of the University of Edinburgh in 1972. It reported in 1974, reviewing developments in the university since 1966 and recommending changes. Due to certain differences, a minority report was also produced.', "The Planning Executive Committee met initially every week and then every month to discuss many aspects of the Institute's activities, including administration, research and funding.", "Although the portrait is unidentified, the same print appears in the Alan Greenwood collection at /6/2/2, where it is credited as 'Professor F.A.E Crew's Presentation Portrait.'

A number of applications were sought for research by individuals including Richard Penry Ambler and Noreen Elizabeth Murray.', "The Institute attracted numerous visitors from around the world, a diversity which is richly revealed in this Visitors' Book, which includes messages from the likes of Oscar Riddle (11 November 1926): 'The 'Animal Breeding and Research Department' is found to be much more than that. It is a new and aggressive center in which both men and problems are undergoing rapid metamorphosis to the great advantage of Biological Science.' The volume also contains a message and signature from H.J Muller, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1946. In the words of F.A.E Crew, the Institute was 'largely a post-graduate school offering scientific hospitality to the senior men from overseas, to scholars of the Ministry and Department of Agriculture, and others who are proceeding to a research degree within the University.'", "A common room was established at King's Buildings as a club for the uses of subscribed members."
