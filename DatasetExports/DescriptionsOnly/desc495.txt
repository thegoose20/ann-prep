"The Japanese tea ceremony, also called the 'way of tea' is a Japanese cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of powdered green tea (matcha). In Japanese the tea ceremony is called chanoyu. Zen Buddhisim was a primary influence in the development of the ceremony and the art and manner in which it is performed.Tea gatherings are classified as: an informal tea gathering or chakai, offering a relatively simple course of hospitality that includes confections, thin tea, and perhaps a light meal; and a formal tea event chaji, usually including a full-course meal followed by confections, thick tea, and thin tea. A chaji can last several hours.Some of the utensils used in the ceremony were: kogo – small ceramic or wooden containers used to hold pieces of incense – their use varied with the seasons – wooden ones holding the chips of incense wood for summer ceremonies – ceramic ones holding kneaded incense in winter ceremonies cha ire – tea container"
