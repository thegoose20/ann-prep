'Hamish A. N. McKenzie was educated in Edinburgh. He became an apprentice chartered accountant in 1953 - an apprenticeship which lasted five years. On sitting his finals he began a degree course in English Literature at Dundee University (then part of St. Andrews University), though he transferred to Edinburgh University from which he was awarded the degree of MA (Hons) in 1967. McKenzie then worked for a chartered accountancy firm in Edinburgh, but took the opportunity of becoming a self-employed chartered accountant in 1975/1976. He bought an office in Corstorphine in 1980, employing two persons, and his firm - called McKenzie and Co. - grew gradually. In 1985 the firm moved to Palmerston Place. Hamish McKenzie retired in 1999 and his junior partner continued the business.'
