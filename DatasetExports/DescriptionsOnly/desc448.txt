"Entitled 'Cilurnum on the Wall', the ms volume has 11 photographs mounted into the pages and the text is written on pasted-in pieces of paper. There is a sketch map of the Great Britain, and a sketch of the layout of the fort."


"Cilurnum was a fort on Hadrian's Wall. It is identified with the fort found at Chesters (Walwick Chesters) near the village of Walwick, Northumberland, England. It was built in 123 AD, just after the completion of the wall. Cilurnum is considered to be the best preserved Roman cavalry fort along Hadrian's Wall, and the site is preserved by English Heritage as Chester's Roman Fort. R. J. Henderson-Begg visited the fort in 1928."
