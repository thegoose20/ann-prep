'Commonplace books were a way of compiling knowledge, usually by writing information into books or notebooks... in effect, scrapbooks... filled with items such as medical recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables, proverbs, prayers, legal and mathematical formulas. They were used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. Every commonplace book was unique to the particular interests of the creator. In this instance the collection of items had a Scottish flavour.'
