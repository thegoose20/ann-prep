"A volume of ink manuscript notes, with pencil annotations, of Hume's Lectures, taken down by a person unknown, but probably a student. The notes relate to lectures delivered between November-December 1805 and with an introductory lecture omitted. Headings include: Marriage; Parent and Child; Guardian and Ward; Master and Servant; and, Personal Rights."


'While it is not clear who wrote these notes of lectures given by Professor David Hume (1757-1838), it is believed that they are either a fair copy made by a student, or copied for sale from the notes of another student. The volume comprises the first twenty-six lectures of Professor Hume given from 12 November 1805 to 27 December 1805. Hume was Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University, 1786-1822.'
