'Coll-808'


'The material is composed of several folders of accounts offering an insight into farming practice throughout the mid-decades of the twentieth century, an impression of the scale of self-sustaining small business in Portobello and district itself, and an idea of the cost of living from the 1930s to the 1970s especially for a small farmer. The firms include insurance companies, animal feed firms, and repair shops. There are accounts from an ironmonger and sheet metal worker in Portobello, the King Oil Company of Cambuslang, McVitie and Price for pig food, and Alexander of Edinburgh, dealers in Lincoln, Ford and Fordson vehicles, and suppliers to Brunstane Farm of a Fordson tractor costing Pounds 100 in 1949. There is also an accounts book covering the period 1932 to 1938, and a small empty account book of Park in account with W. J. Hunter, Butcher and Poulterer, 278 High Street, Portobello.'


'Brunstane Farm is located by Portobello and Joppa, north east Edinburgh. It lies between Brunstane Burn and Newcraighall.'
