In 1756 he was appointed Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University - only the third holder of that Chair, after Robert Smith and Joseph Gibson, the first holder. Young was the first Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh to actually lecture on the subject of obstetrics. He also had an association with Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary.
