'Coll-11'


"There is a substantial sequence of notebooks and working papers containing detailed notes of experiments and dissections together with drawings and drafts for lectures, and a separate sequence of manuscripts for lectures and addresses. There are many autograph letters from eminent anatomists and medical men, including ten letters from Joseph Lister. An item of particular interest is an album of 96 photographs from Cunningham's service on the South African War Royal Commission. The subjects include army camps and infirmaries, railroads and the native population. Many of the documents bear annotations by Cunningham's son, John.Click HERE to see a detailed handlist."


"Cunningham was born at Crieff, Perth, and educated at the Morrison's Academy, Crieff, and Edinburgh University graduating M.B. in 1874. He was Demonstrator in Anatomy at Edinburgh, 1876-1882, and Professor of Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, 1882, at Dublin University, 1883-1903, and at Edinburgh University, 1903-1909. He carried out original research in human and comparative anatomy as well as in the wider field of anthropology including giantism and right-handedness and left-brainedness. He undertook a number of important public duties including service in 1900 with the Royal Commission on the Care of the Sick and the Wounded during the South African War. He was elected FRS in 1891."
