'Coloured lithograph, some marginal browning. 394 x 267 mm.'


"Satirical illustration, 'The balance of public favor', showing Sir Walter Scott sitting in an upper scale supporting on his knees the nine volumes of Napoleon. He looks down, absorbed and melancholy at Thomas Moore sitting on the lower scale holding up a small volume to Scott, the Epicurean a prose tale based on the unpublished poem Alcipheron, which outweighs his rival's bulky compilation. Both men were to publish their works the same day."
