"Scottish poet, writer, artist and gardener Ian Hamilton Finlay, CBE, was born in Nassau, Bahamas, on 28 October 1925. He was educated at Dollar Academy, in Clackmannanshire, Scotland. In 1942, he joined the army, fighting in the Second World War.After the war, Finlay worked as a shepherd, and then began to write short stories and poems, while living on Rousay, in Orkney. He published his first book, The Sea Bed and Other Stories (1958) and some of his plays were broadcast on the BBC. His stories often featured in the newspapers. A collection of poetry followed, The Dancers Inherit the Party (1960). It was as a 'concrete poet' though that Finlay gained renown after he published Rapel (1963) - 'concrete poetry' laying importance on the layout and typography of the words to give effect. He then began to compose poems for inscription into stone which were incorporated into sculptures for the natural environment. Out of this emerged the 5-acre garden at Little Sparta in the Pentlands near Edinburgh, created together with his wife Sue Finlay.Finlay received a Turner Prize nomination in 1985. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Aberdeen University in 1987, Heriot-Watt University in 1993 and the University of Glasgow in 2001, and an honorary and/or visiting professorship from the University of Dundee in 1999.

He also worked with a host of lettering artists including Michael Harvey and Nicholas Sloan. He also collaborated with Joanne Soroka who produced tapestries based on Finlay's 'concrete poetry'. These mainly consisted of one-word-per-line short poems.Ian Hamilton Finlay became a CBE in 2002, and he died on 27 March 2006.Award-winning artist Joanne Soroka was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1949.
