"The Cheshire antiquary and historian George Ormerod was born in High Street, Manchester, on 20 October 1785. He attended King's School, Chester, then was educated privately by the Rev. Thomas Bancroft at Bolton-le-Moors, Lancashire. He studied at Brasenose College, Oxford. Early in his life he became interested in heraldry and topography, and from around 1808 he began to form large collections on the history of Cheshire. Ormerod's publications includeThe history of the County Palatine and City of Chester(1816),Parentalia: genealogical memoirs(1851), andRemarks on a line of earth-works in Tidenham, known as Offa's Dyke(1859). Later in his life Ormerod became blind and he died at Sedbury Park, Gloucestershire, on 9 October 1873."
