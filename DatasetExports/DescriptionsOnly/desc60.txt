"Two Riverswas an ambitious quarterly literary journal edited by Martin Green and Paul Durcan. The journal aimed to 'contribute to a climate more sympathetic to the writer, not only to publishing the work of young and previously unknown authors, but by giving space to already established poets'. There were only two issues: Winter 1969; Spring 1970. Contributors included Hugh MacDiarmid (Christopher Grieve)."
