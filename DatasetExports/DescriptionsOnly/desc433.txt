"The Tragara Press was founded by Alan Anderson (b. 1922) in the early-1950s when he also studied printing at Edinburgh College of Art. Although the first book with a Tragara Press imprint appeared in 1954, Anderson worked mainly as a bookseller until the 1970s before devoting himself to printing and publishing full-time. He moved to Loanhead, Midlothian, in 1986, and then latterly to Beauly, Inverness-shire. The name, Tragara Press, is derived from the Punta Tragara hotel on the island of Capri, Italy, which had been a favourite destination for Anderson. Donald Weeks the Corvo scholar and biographer was a prolific contributor to the bibliography of the Tragara Press. Weeks was born on 18 April 1921, in Detroit, Michigan. As a child he had a talent for art and design, and he specialised in industrial design at Cass Technical High School, Detroit, before winning a scholarship to Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. After service with US Military Intelligence in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War, he returned to Detroit. There he worked as a freelance graphic designer, and became art editor of the Chevrolet in-house magazine. Week's had developed an interest in European literature and he became fascinated with the works of author Frederick William Rolfe (Baron Corvo) (1860-1913). Research into Rolfe led Donald Weeks to England in 1960, and then he moved there in 1966. He spent much of the rest of the 1960s following in Rolfe's footsteps, and began writing a biography. Weeks' work on Corvo (published by Tragara) would go much deeper than that of A. J. A. Symons in his Quest for Corvo (1952). Donald Weeks died in Middlesex Hospital on 7 September 2003. Frederick Rolfe was born in Cheapside, London, on 22 July 1860. He taught briefly at The King's School, Grantham. He converted to Catholicism in 1886 and he had a strong desire to become a priest though this was not fulfilled. He did however attend, for a while, the Scots College in Rome and during this time entered the circle of Caroline Shirley, Duchess Sforza Cesarini (1818-1897). He claimed that she had adopted him as a grandson giving him the title, Baron Corvo. Baron Corvo would become Rolfe's best-known pseudonym, though others were Frank English, Frederick Austin, and A. Crab Maid among others. He spent most of his life as a freelance writer, mainly in England but eventually in Venice, relying on benefactors for support. His principal work of fiction was Hadrian the Seventh (1904). Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo, died on 25 October 1913 and is buried on the Isola di San Michele, Venice."
