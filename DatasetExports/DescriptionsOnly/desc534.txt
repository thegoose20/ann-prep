'Originally called Blair Bog, the Whim estate was purchased circa 1730 by Archibald, Earl of Islay, afterwards the 3rd Duke of Argyll. The dwelling house on the estate, Whim Hall, was erected 1731-34. It is set amidst 20 acres of striking country woodland in the Scottish Borders. Both William Adam and John Adam had influenced the building operations. James Montgomery (1721-1803) purchased The Whim from the 4th Duke of Argyll in 1763. In 1775 Montgomery he was created Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and 1st Baron Stanhope.From the turn of the 19th century the house was in the possession of John Maitland Thomson (1847-1923), Curator of Historical Records, and then Deputy Keeper of the Records in Edinburgh. Later owners of Whim House were the Hannah family. In another guise it was Whim House Hotel, and today it is Whim Hall Nursing Home.'
