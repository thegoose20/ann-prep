This comes after Lyell and Buckland made their discoveries in Scotland in 1824, but whilst he was also maintaining a law practice, funded by his father. Lyell was greatly involved with the Geological Society, serving as Secretary with George Poulett Scrope in 1825, and presenting papers on Tertiary exposures of the Hampshire coast in 1826. During the course of this notebook, Lyell began writing the first drafts of Principles of Geology. The first manuscript was delivered to the publisher at the close of 1827.During this period, Lyell's eyes, weakened from a time spent in Tuscany as a youth, grew stronger, and allowed him to plan trips further afield to Europe. Most biographies point to this period of time when he resolved to dedicate his time to his geology work. While working as a barrister on the western circuit, Lyell reads the evolutionary theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) and realizes that the mutability of species would affect geology as much as the biological sciences. Lyell nonetheless concludes that the fossil record is too imperfect to support the theory of evolution, and that the physical world is a stable balanced system.", 'Slip of paper referred to in Coll-203 Gen. 109 Lyell 1/527, giving detailed botanical editorial instructions concerning kelp and the growth of coal period trees, vegetation patterns and the resultant fossils.', "Letter to Sir Charles Lyell from Carlo Gemmellaro regarding his volcanic research on Mount Etna.

They visited geological locations around the capital Christiania (now Oslo), with the professor of geology at the University of Christiania Baltazar M. Keilhau as guide. Many of Lyell\'s theories about metamorphic and plutonic rocks were confirmed from his observations, and these confirmations were included in Elements of Geology , published the following year, in 1838. This was nearing the end of his two year presidency of the Geological Society, and during a tempestuous time for the science, when theories about evolution of the species were particularly divisive. In correspondence with Whewell in March of 1837 about the possibilities of the origination of new species, Lyell wrote why he left this topic to inference in Principles of Geology; ""If I had stated... the possibility of the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural, in contradistinction to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host of prejudices against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every step to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these mysterious subjects."
