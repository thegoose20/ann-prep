Laing was able, occasionally, to travel abroad in search of rare or curious books. In 1821, he became a partner in his father's business and throughout his life he was an avid collector of manuscripts and rescued many from destruction. The first published work of his own was Auctarium Bibliothecae Edinburgenae sive Catalogus Librorum quos Gulielmus Drummondus ab Hawthornden D.D.Q. Anno 1627 (1815). Among other works, Laing also reprinted Thomas Craig's Epithalamium on the marriage of Darnley and Mary Stuart (1821). When Sir Walter Scott founded the Bannatyne Club in 1823 for the printing of material and tracts relating to Scottish history and literature, Laing - a friend of Scott's - became Secretary of the Club and chief organiser until its dissolution in the 1860s. Laing was also associated with the Abbotsford Club, the Spalding Club, and the Wodrow Society, each of which had been set up for the publication of manuscripts and for the revival of old texts. When the keepership of the Advocates' Library fell vacant in 1818, Laing was a candidate but was not elected. He became Keeper of the Library to the Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet, a post which he occupied from 1837 until his death. On his appointment to the post, he gave up his business as a bookseller and disposed of the stock in a public sale. Laing died at Portobello, in Edinburgh, on 18 October 1878.", "Inglis was a Scottish calligrapher born in London to French parents, who produced about 55 miniature manuscript books between 1586 and 1624 and whose work was much admired and collected in her lifetime. Esther Inglis was a daughter of Nicholas Langlois and his wife, Marie Presot, French Huguenots who migrated to London in about 1569 and to Scotland by 1574. Presot was an accomplished calligrapher who taught her daughter writing. In about 1596 Inglis married Bartholomew Kello, a clerk and sometime cleric. All but three of her books were signed with her maiden name (meaning 'English') in either its French (Langlois) or Scottish (Inglis) form, although in modern libraries her work is usually catalogued under the name Kello. She was an expert calligrapher, writing a variety of hands with equal skill in miniature form. Sometimes the letters were scarcely a millimetre high. She also decorated her books with paintings and drawings, and she often included self-portraits in them (based on a portrait from 1595, now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery). Inglis dedicated her manuscripts to European royalty, including Queen Elizabeth I, as well as to other aristocrats. It is likely that she was paid for her work."
