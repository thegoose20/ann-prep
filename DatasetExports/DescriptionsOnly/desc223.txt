"Music manuscript - the aria Tu che voli gi'd spirto beata from Fausta."


"Gaetano Donizetti was born in Bergamo on 29 November 1797. Donizetti was given some musical instruction from a priest who was also the musical director at the main church in Bergamo. As a choirboy though, Donizetti did not shine, but the priest recognised in him a nascent musical ability and managed to have him enrolled at the Liceo Filarmonico - the musical school - in Bergamo. He received training in fugue and counterpoint, and it was at the school that he launched his operatic career. After writing some minor work he went to Naples, then Rome and Milan, and wrote some 31 operas in only twelve years. He became internationally known in 1830 with his Anna Bolena which was premiered in Milan. Donizetti's most famous work was Lucia di Lammermoor (1835). Gaetano Donizetti died insane on 8 April 1848. Fausta is a two-act opera by Gaetano Donizetti. The Italian libretto was by Domenico Gilardoni, who died while writing it, and the remainder was written by Donizetti. The opera was given its debut on 12 January 1832 at the Teatro San Carlo, in Naples, Italy."
