"Ms volume in modern binding. The spine title is: 'Genealogie of the Campbells - Ewen MacDougall', though the name is lacking in the ms itself. The text begins: 'This Clan were of old called Clan o Duibn (or rather Duibhn with bh according to the irish Silabication, bh and mk with them of the same value with the consonant v or vau in latine or English) I say of old so called from the famous Knights and Champions the o Duibhns...'. The author refers to the Campbells being known 'for faithfulness to the Crown and Kingdom in the history of Sir William Wallace and King Robert Bruce about 350 or 360 years ago', placing the authorship circa 1650-1660. This does not accord however with the active dates of MacDougall the clerk."


'Ewen MacDougall of Kingharrie, near Loch Tay, was a clerk to the Earl of Breadalbane in the early 19th century. His antiquarian interests led him to copy and compile a list of families (clans) connected to the Campbells.'
