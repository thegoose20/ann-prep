'Volume of manuscript notes in Latin, ink on paper, quarto. A few initial letters and chapter headings with penwork decoration. Believed to be associated with Francis Scott (Franciscus Scott). The name of Scott and his initials appear in many penned chapter headings throughout the volume. A coat-of-arms of the Scott family of Buccleuch has been penned in one of the margins. The manuscript volume was compiled during 1661 and 1662, and at the time James Pilan was one of the regent masters teaching philosophy at the University of Edinburgh.'


'Francis Scott (fl. 1661-1662) may have been connected with the Scott family of Buccleuch.'
