There are also circa 19 programmes of the operatic programmes at Dresden Opera House, 1911. Also within the album are three letters to 'Eleanor W. Dolie' (Dollie?) addressed to a Paris address. The album holds the signature 'Eleanor W. Dolie' (Dollie?) facing inside cover, and was presented by 'Miss Eleanor Hughes'."


"Dresden's Opera House was built 1871-1878 as the 'Altstaedter Hoftheater - Koenigliches Opernhaus' by Gottfried Semper and Manfred Semper. It was opened on 2 February 1878 with Goethe's 'Iphigenie auf Tauris'. Over the period 1912-1914 there were alterations of the interior decoration of the building. In 1919 it was renamed 'Saechsische Staatsoper'. In 1938 there was a renovation of the auditorium. The building was destroyed by bombs over the night of 13-14 February 1945. Over the period 1945-1955 safety works were carried out on the site and the remains, and afterwards it was left as a ruin until 1977. Between 1977-1985 it was rebuilt to Semper's plans with slight alterations and the addition of modern extension buildings. It was re-opened 13 February 1985."
