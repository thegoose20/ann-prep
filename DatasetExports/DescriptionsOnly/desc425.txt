"Later on in his life, John Middleton Murry (1889-1957), the writer, reviewer and critic, became interested in self supporting agricultural communities and set up Lodge Farm at Thelnetham - just inside Suffolk, and close to Norfolk. The run down Lodge Farm was bought as Murry's last attempt at forming a community, having earlier in his life purchased a farm in Langham, Essex (in 1934). Murry and Max Plowman (1883-1941), writer and pacifist, established a pacifist community centre on the land which they called the Adelphi Centre. John Middleton Murry is buried in the churchyard at Thelnetham. Murry had written Community Farm in 1952. At Hopton, near Diss, Suffolk, and near to Thelnetham and Murry's Lodge Farm, lived the historian, writer and collector Victor Skipp (1925-2010). Skipp, a Cambridge graduate, specialised in writing about the industrial revolution of the West Midlands."
