"There are 11 gelatin silver prints, ranging from approximately 15.2 x 9.4 cms to 14.6 x 18 cms, of which 10 are album mounted. 1 loose print is signed 'Yours lovingly, Marjorie'. The prints are held in an album with beige-coloured card wrappers and the top cover states, 'Mr Wu / And / Much Ado About Nothing / 1930'.There are 2 programme cut-outs which have been pasted into the album...: The Mary Hay Players in conjunction with the Reading Branch of the British Empire Shakespeare Society, Reading, 'Mr Wu' [...] Wednesday 29 January; and, The Mary Hay Players in conjunction with the Reading Branch of the British Empire Shakespeare Society, Reading, 'Much Ado About Nothing' [...] Monday 27 January.The plays were put on by the Mary Hay Players, one of whom was 'Marjorie' (Marjorie Watson) who was the Property Mistress for the productions and the actress playing Ursula in Much Ado About Nothing and Hilda Gregory in Mr Wu.The illustrations are less about capturing the actors during a performance, and more about scening and posing to fully portray the costume, props and character portrayals."


"The British Empire Shakespeare Society was founded in 1901 by Greta Morritt with the aim of promoting Shakespeare's works through reading societies, essays, and prizes for acting the playwright poet's works. By 1939 there were 10,000 members throughout the world."
