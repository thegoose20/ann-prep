"Edmonstone is south east of Edinburgh, adjacent to Little France and to Craigmillar, historically in the parish of Newton in Midlothian. Its name derives from Edmund's tun, or farm. The estate belonged to the Edmonstone family from 1248 until the early 17th century. It briefly belonged to the Rait family before passing to John Wauchope (1633-1709) in 1671, through marriage. Wauchope was related to the Wauchopes of Niddrie Merschell. In 1672 he became Lord of Session and assumed the title Lord Edmonstone. Like the estates of neighbouring Niddry and Duddingston, there had been coal on the Edmonstone estate. In the 1940s the roof of Edmonstone House was removed by surviving family in an effort to escape taxation and it subsequently fell into decay. Today, Edmonstone is part of suburban and built-up Edinburgh and close to the outer ring road."
