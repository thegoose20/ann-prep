"The Address Database was used to store information on individuals and organisations interested in SA '97 and for the distribution of the Newsletter and other publicity.", "During the course of Scotland Africa '97, Kemi Adebayo, the Aberdeen Coordinator, made certain allegations about the funding of Scotland Africa '97 and this led to a dispute over expenses. The documents here outline the nature of this incident and explain how it was resolved.", 'The Event Database was used to help link artists wishing to take part with venues wishing to stage an event.', "Scotland Africa '97 (SA '97) was an umbrella organisation which aimed at the strengthening of existing links between Scotland and Africa and the creation of new routes to understanding and co-operation. Between May and October 1997, a series of cultural events took place with these aims in mind, under the bannerScotland Africa '97. Because of the positive feedback and the success of the events generally, it was decided to set up an archive serving as a record of the events held. It was hoped that the archive could be used as a source for researchers examining the impact of SA '97 and as a resource for anyone looking for information about the organisations involved. The idea for the series of cultural events came from the Centre of African Studies at Edinburgh University. It was intended that the events should raise the profile of Africa and explore the historical and contemporary links between Scotland and the huge continent. The events held were both large and small, and although many were held in Edinburgh, SA '97 offices had been established in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen to support the events of organisations all over the country, from Dundee and Musselburgh, to Argyll and Inverness, and from Kelso and Dumfries, to Banchory and Stromness. The events ranged from an African ceramics exhibition, fashion show, and African storytime for children, to a rhino awareness week, a play about Mungo Park, and an exhibition on Mary Slessor.", 'Evening hosted by: Professor Alexander McCall Smith, Faculty of Law Edinburgh, University of Edinburgh, Old College Edinburgh.', 'Also shown at Inverness Museum & Art Gallery.', 'Also shown at Edinburgh College of Art.'
