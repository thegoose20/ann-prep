"The Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for Public Service in India was a medal awarded by the British monarch between 1900 and 1947. It was awarded to civilians of any nationality who rendered distinguished service in the advancement of the interests of British India. The name, Kaisar-i-Hind, means 'Emperor of India' in the vernacular of the Hindi and Urdu languages. The word 'kaisar', meaning 'emperor' is a derivative of the Roman imperial title Caesar. It is also cognate with the German title Kaiser, which was borrowed from Latin. The medal was instituted by Queen Victoria on 10 April 1900. The title of Empress of India or Kaisar-i-Hind was taken by Victoria from 1 May 1876, and proclaimed at the Delhi Durbar of 1877. Following Victoria, Queen Empress, were the King Emperors, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII (briefly) and George VI. The Royal Warrant for the Kaisar-i-Hind was amended in 1901, 1912, 1933 and 1939, and while never formally rescinded, the Kaisar-i-Hind ceased to be awarded following the passage of the Indian Independence Act 1947. The Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for Public Service in India had three grades. The Gold medal was awarded directly by the monarch on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for India. Silver and Bronze medals were awarded by the Viceroy. The most famous recipient of the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal is Mohandas Gandhi, who was awarded it in 1915."
