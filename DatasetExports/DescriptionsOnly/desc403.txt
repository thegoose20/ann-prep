His library career included periods at: the National Central Library (which would become a part of the British Library); the College of St. Mark and St. John, Exeter; the LSE and SOAS; the India Office; and, the British Library. He retired in 1990. Bloomfield's Master's thesis was a bibliography of the works of W. H. Auden which went to publication as W. H. Auden, a bibliography: the early years through 1955 (1964). Collaborating with Edward Mendelson (b. 1946), Bloomfield published a greatly expanded 2nd edition of the bibliography in 1972, and the newer work carried the bibliographical record up to 1969. He also compiled Philip Larkin, a bibliography 1933-1976, (1979) Barry Cambray Bloomfield died in Wye, Kent, on 26 February 2002.
