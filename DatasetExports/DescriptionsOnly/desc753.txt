"Samuel Solomonovich Koteliansky was born in 1880. His translations of nineteenth century Russian writers first started to appear in the 1920s. He translated some of the so-called 'untranslatable' and extremely difficult Russian texts including the diaries, personal letters and notebooks of Anton Chekhov and others. He also translated I. A. Bunin and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Samuel Solomonovich Koteliansky died in 1955."
