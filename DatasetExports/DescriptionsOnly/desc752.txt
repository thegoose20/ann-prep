"The material consists of Erskine's correspondence with the Rev. Dr. J. Ryland."


'The theologian John Erskine was born in Edinburgh in 1721. He was educated at Edinburgh University and became a minister. He was ordained Minister of Kirkintilloch in 1744. Early in his career he cultivated relations with other churches and ministers in Europe and in colonised countries, particularly in America. When it became obvious that Britain and the States would part company he wrote many pamphlets urging both sides to make concessions and to avert war. Erskine also cultivated relations with churches and ministers in the Netherlands and Germany. In 1753 he became Minister at Culross, Fife, and was also Minister at Greyfriars in Edinburgh. The degree of D.D. was conferred on him by Glasgow University in 1766. His publications includeTheological dissertations(1765),Considerations on the spirit of Popery(1778), and the two volumes ofSketches and hints of church history and theological controversy, chiefly translated and abridged from modern foreign writers(1790 and 1797). John Erskine D.D. died on 19 January 1803.'
