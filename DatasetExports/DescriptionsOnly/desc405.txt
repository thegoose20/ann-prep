"Robert Harold Mumford was born in Belfast on 11 July 1898. He attended Fulneck School, near Leeds between 1908 and 1915. In October 1919 he matriculated at Edinburgh University, studying Medicine, and indicated that he was from Baildon, near Shipley, Yorkshire. He graduated with the degrees of M.B. and Ch.B in July 1924, and his address in Edinburgh at that time was Livingstone Dispensary, Cowgate, Edinburgh. Mumford was a runner and ran in the Edinburgh University 'Hare and Hounds' running club team. The first inaugural meeting of the 'Hare and Hounds' running club was in 1890, though an Edinburgh University Harriers running club existing between 1874-1887. The 'Hare and Hounds' ran their first major race in 1890 for the University Blue, the most prestigious sports award for University athletes. This saw six runners compete for the club. They began to participate in more and more races as the turn of the century approached. They took part in the Scottish Junior Cross Country Championships in 1891-92 and the first Senior National Cross Country Championships in 1893-94. The Club also had an annual race against Dublin University, which was regarded as club's main event of the year."
