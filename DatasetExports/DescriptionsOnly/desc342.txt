"Betty D. Gibson was one of the secretarial staff of the International Missionary Council (IMC) in which she played a significant role acting as secretary and administrator for both the IMC and for Joseph Oldham. A graduate in French and German, in 1916 she joined the staff of Oldham's Continuation Committee which had been set up after the 1910 World Missionary Conference. She made several trips overseas for missionary conferences or to investigate the state and extent of missionary activity in various countries. She frequently wrote letters home, or kept diaries and notes of her visits and findings, some of which survive in this collection."
