"Frederick Kidd was born in 1864 in the parish of Lorum, Bagenalstown, Co. Carlow, Ireland. He was a student of veterinary science in Edinburgh during the period 1882 to 1888 - attending the Royal 'Dick' Veterinary College. He then went on to practice as a veterinarian, in Bagenalstown in Co. Carlow, Ireland.There at Long Range, Bagenalstown, along with his family, he worked most of his professional life as a country veterinarian. Indeed, Frederick Kidd must have been one of the few professionally qualified veterinary surgeons to work in Ireland at the time. Communication across the country was very different at that time too, reliant as it was on letter post and Post Office 'wires'. His transport was by pony and trap on poor roads. Nevertheless, Carlow would become the first inland town in Ireland and Britain to receive electrical power.His wife was Sarah Anne (nee Tennant), and they had four children. Sydney George (Boy 1st Class), was drowned aged 17 when the vessel he was serving aboard, HMS Viknor, an Armed Merchant Cruiser of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, was lost off Tory Island, Donegal, on 13 January 1915, during the First World War. Sydney's siblings Irene, Edith and Victor had all died by 1980.Frederick Kidd retired in 1932. He died not long after on 4 August 1934, aged 70 years. He was buried in Old Dunleckney graveyard, Bagenalstown, alongside his wife who predeceased him on 28 September 1926."
