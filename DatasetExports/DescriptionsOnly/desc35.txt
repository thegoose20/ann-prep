"The Edinburgh University Sailing Club (EUSC) was founded in 1933 as the Edinburgh University Yacht Club. EUSC is one of the largest sports clubs within the University and its dinghy teams are the most successful teams in Scotland. EUSC is located at the Edinburgh University Sports Union, Pleasance, Edinburgh. Club sailing takes place at Linlithgow Loch, West Lothian, for dinghies, and Largs (Clyde) and Port Edgar (Forth) for yachting. The EUSC is a group member of the Linlithgow Loch Sailing Club. In the 1980s and 1990s EUSC meetings were held on Tuesdays in the Pleasance, and in more recent years at the Wash Bar, Mound, Edinburgh, on Wednesday evenings. The EUSC Cameron Trophy sailing event has been held at Firbush - the University's field centre on Loch Tay - and in the Firth of Forth (the 35th Cameron Trophy was hosted by the Royal Forth Yacht Club). The Trophy has traditionally been held over a weekend during Freshers Week at Firbush, or rather during the weekend immediately before the start of the Autumn term. Club records also show that there has been a Sailing Club Regatta held in in May. The Club has held grand social events such as the Edinburgh University Watersports Ball which was often held at the Prestonfield House Hotel, Edinburgh, but was, in November 1989, held at the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh, as well as dinner dances, Hallowe'en, Christmas and Burns functions. Some of these still happen, along with beer and skittles and pub quizzes. The above-mentioned Cameron Trophy had been presented by Lord Cameron to the Edinburgh University Sports Union in the early 1970s. Lord Cameron had served with the RNVR in both world wars and in the Second World War had held the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. He was an honorary commodore of the Forth Yacht Club and was awarded an honorary blue for his interest in Edinburgh University sport. He held a particular interest in sailing and so the Sports Union decided to invite the EUSC to run an annual regatta at which the winner would be presented with the Cameron Trophy which he had presented. Earlier in the Club's history the trophy was called the Lord Cameron Trophy. Lord Cameron died in 1996, aged 96."
