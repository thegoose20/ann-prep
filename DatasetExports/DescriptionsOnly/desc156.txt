"The letter is headed: Greengates, Seamill, West Kilbride. It is dated 28 September 1943. The saluation is 'My dear Katherine' and the letter is signed M.M.M. It refers to how Katherine 'had been the most successful of the MOI people in Orkney'. This had been read in the newspapers. Katherine then had 'further exploits among the Sassanachs' and that Terry was with her. MMM writes that Mr. Muir is being cared for and Isobel 'has had a turn of not being too well'. M.M.M. has sent Katherine 'the book' and wishes her 'the best with its reconstruction'."


"In 1943, MMM appeared to be living in Seamill, West Kilbride (North Ayrshire). She wrote a typescript letter to 'Katherine' in September 1943. Typed on the rear of the letter was: Keep this address beside you: Miss Sheila Hodges, Director, Victor Gollancz Ltd. Sheila Hodges apparently joined the publishing firm of Victor Gollancz in 1936, becoming Assistant Managing Director in 1943 to take charge of the editorial department. Taking over from Daphne du Maurier's previous editor who had been called up during the war, she edited the works of Daphne du Maurier over a period spanning nearly forty years from 1943-1981."
