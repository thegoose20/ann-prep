'Coll-728'


"The material is composed of a diary kept by Drummond, and includes R.B's diary (the initials of a woman he was unable to marry), 1736-1738."


"George Drummond, six times Lord Provost of Edinburgh, was born in Edinburgh on 27 June 1687. In 1707 he was appointed Accountant-General of Excise when it was introduced into Scotland after the Union. He was a Hanoverian and worked closely for the defeat of the Jacobites in 1715. He became Lord Provost of Edinburgh for the first time in 1725. When the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary was founded in 1736, Drummond was one of its managers. In 1745 he raised a band of volunteers to defend the city against the Jacobites. During his Lord Provostship the city was extended northwards to include the area upon which the New Town is now built. It was at this time too that the Nor' Loch was drained, and North Bridge built. George Drummond died on 4 November 1766."
