"James Hog was born around 1658. He graduated from Edinburgh University with an M.A. in 1677, and then studied theology in the Netherlands. He was ordained as Minister of Dalserf parish in the Presbytery of Hamilton in 1691. Hog was elected as a member of the General Assembly in 1695. In 1699 he became Minister of Carnock, Fife. He belonged to a stricter wing of the Church of Scotland that took a stand against the more tolerant attitudes that had begun to arise within the Church. With his re-publication of the Marrow of modern divinity (1718), he started the 'Marrow' controversy. The book was denounced by the Assembly in 1720. Rev. James Hog died on 14 May 1734."
