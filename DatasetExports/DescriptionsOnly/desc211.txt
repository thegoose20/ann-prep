"The letter from Christison, 40 Moray Place [ Edinburgh], Monday 4 August [1862], to David Cousin of the City Chambers, refers to a 'long report' read by Dr. Bennett, on the Buildings Committee of the University. The report referred to how 'a careful survey' found the buildings were 'in a condition of great disrepair'. With regard to this, Christison had found, as 'Convenor of Finance', that he had 'a sum of Â£300' available in the general accounts, and explained that since Dr. Bennett and the 'other members of the Buildings Committee' were in London, and he had been 'suddenly substituted', but had been 'at last floored and in bed' with an illness, he was sure that 'a few minutes of conversation' would enable him to empower Cousin 'to proceed'. The letter then refers to how he had followed the example of his colleagues and had accordingly arranged to leave town for Dumfriesshire from the following Monday and would stay there for ten days."
