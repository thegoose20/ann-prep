"A 'meeting of persons in favour of the formation of a Branch of the Historical Association of Scotland' was held at the [Royal] High School, Edinburgh, on Wednesday 6 December 1911, at 8p.m. The Rev. Dr. John Morrison took the Chair on the motion of Mr. W. Ross who acted as Secretary. The name of the Branch put forward, voted upon, and carried, was 'Edinburgh and South-East of Scotland Branch'. At this meeting, the Rev. Professor A. R. MacEwen (1851-1916) was proposed as the first President, and this was accepted unanimously. The first annual general meeting (AGM) of the Edinburgh and South-East of Scotland Branch of the Historical Association of Scotland was held on 15 November 1912. The Rev. Professor A. R. MacEwen was a Scottish writer, and minister, and he was appointed Moderator of the United Free Church of Scotland in 1915. He retired from the Presidency of the Edinburgh and South-East of Scotland Branch (Historical Association of Scotland) in 1916 due to ill-health. The second President of the Branch was Professor Sir Richard Lodge (1855-1936).
