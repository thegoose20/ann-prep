Biogen brought proceedings against Medeva over alleged infringement of their patent for a method of producing HBV antigens from recombinant DNA, which was based on research carried out under Ken Murray at the University of Edinburgh on Hepatitis B. Biogen had filed two second patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO) in 1978 and 1979, although the latter was only granted in 1990. The patent could be construed in such a way that it could in effect block all other ways of achieving the same result via different routes. The validity of the patent was challenged by opponents at the EPO's own tribunal, although the EPO found the patent valid on 28 July 1994.The first court in the UK to hear the dispute with Medeva was the Patents Court (part of the English High Court), where Judge Aldous found that Biogen's patent was valid and had been infringed. Medeva successfully appealed to the English Court of Appeal, which found that the patent was invalid on the grounds of obviousness and insufficiency. Biogen then appealed to the House of Lords who, assisted by two scientific advisers (which was unusual), heard the case in May 1996 and gave their decision on 31 October of that year. This was the first time that the House of Lords had considered a genetic engineering patent.", 'Kenneth Murray was a Visiting Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Adelaide during the year 1976.', 'This arbitration concerned the termination of the License and Development Agreement into which Biogen and Wellcome entered in August 1984 concerning the development of a hepatitis B vaccine.', 'Kenneth Murray attended Henry Mellish Grammar School in Nottingham from 1941-1947.

Its purpose was to exploit the commercial potential of advanced microbiological science, principally DNA recombinant technology and advanced mutational technology.The company was established initially around a Scientific Advisory Board consisting of nine members, including Kenneth Murray, who recommended projects to be pursued by the company, some of which were initiated in the University laboratories of the Board members. One such project was the Hepatitis B project pursued by Kenneth Murray at the University of Edinburgh, which was one of the company's early scientific successes. This success hinged on the licensing arrangements under its patents relating to Hepatitis B antigens for both diagnostic and vaccine purposes. An agreement put in place with the University of Edinburgh ensured that the University would receive a proportion of the patent royalties as well as a royalty on sales of products manufactured and sold by the company. Biogen also had a Supervisory Board of Directors comprising representatives of the venture capitalist sponsors of the company, the financial community and members of the Scientific Board.Biogen opened its own research laboratories in Geneva in 1979. As the company's financial strength grew, additional laboratories were established in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This enabled Biogen to benefit from the intense scientific activity in the area of genetic engineering and related technologies in the United States, and the proximity of some of the Scientific Board members at Harvard and MIT. In 1983 Biogen became a public company with its stock trading on Wall Street. The company sold its Geneva operations to Glaxo in 1987.Biogen originally derived income from licensing arrangements of its technology, patents and products with various pharmaceutical companies, but by the end of 1983 it was decided to concentrate on high value products in the pharmaceutical industry, an approach which proved too resource-heavy for the company. After a period of retrenchment, Biogen's fortunes began to revive under a new Chief Executive Officer, James Vincent, who joined the company in 1985. A company restructure, new licensing arrangements and a focus on select scientific areas and products which the company could develop itself, saw Biogen operating close to a 'break even' situation by 1988.In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merge, Biogen Idec became the third largest biotechnology company in the world. Following shifts in research core areas, the company reverted to the shorter name of Biogen.
