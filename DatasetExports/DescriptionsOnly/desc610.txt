'The Round Table Club, Edinburgh, arose out of the wish among rising medical graduates for occasional meetings "simply for the purpose of good fellowship". On 8 December 1868 a party of ten men deemed likely to be "suitable members" met at dinner at the invitation of Dr. Robert James Blair Cunynghame, St. Colme Street, Edinburgh. The diners were: Dr. Cunynghame, Professor Alexander Dickson, Dr. Archibald Dickson, Dr. John Chiene, Dr. Thomas Annandale, Dr. John Duncan, Dr. Thomas Fraser, Dr. Joseph Bell, Dr. Claud Muirhead, and Alexander Crum Brown. These would become the original members of the Round Table Club, and an invitation was also opened to Arthur Gamgee and William Rutherford. The first meeting of the Club was held at Meikle\'s Hotel, Register Street, Edinburgh.'
