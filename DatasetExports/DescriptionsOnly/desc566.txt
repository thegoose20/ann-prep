"This item may have been created by the elder William Henry Haggard (1729-1813), or his son William Henry Haggard, Junior (1757-1837)... the Haggard family of Knebworth Place, Herts., England, and later, Bradenham Hall, Norfolk. The family adopted the name 'Rider' in the late-18th century and were ancestors of the writer H. Rider Haggard (1856-1925).The detailed Hebrew study appears to have been written as a textbook, perhaps as an aid to Bible study in the family. Several members of the Haggard family were clergymen."
