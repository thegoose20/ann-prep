Furthermore, the glue used to affix recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder \'Letters from various Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80\', all letters were already freed from pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split into four bundles: in bundles \'James Kennedy\' and \'Robert Kennedy\', they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles \'Marjory, James, Robert Kennedy\' and \'Miscellaneous\', they are in no particular order. Letters in bundle \'Miscellaneous\' are still folded, whereas all other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder \'\'Sir Granville Bantock\', D.19228, E61/19\', are in fair condition; 94 letters were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters and not to pages, two letters remain unnumbered. One further letter from Granville Bantock to Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, dated 25 Jul 1924, is in Gen. 278. Work Done - All items dusted with brush and put into new archive envelopes.

'Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, singer, pianist, folk-song collector and arranger, was born in 1857. She was the daughter of singer David Kennedy (1825-1886). Her series of works The songs of the Hebrides, published variously between 1909 and 1922 remain a useful resource for both Gaelic and English speakers. She collected songs chiefly in the Western Isles. Aware that the material collected would, in the concert performance, lose something of the original essence, she provided the songs with sensitive accompaniment. For service rendered to the cause of music in Scotland, an honorary degree of Doctor of Music was conferred on her in 1928. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser had also been awarded the C.B.E. She died on 22 November 1930.'
