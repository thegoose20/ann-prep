'James S. K. Elmslie, the son of a butcher, became qualified as a Veterinary Surgeon in Edinburgh in 1934 having studied at the then Royal (Dick) Veterinary College in the city. His career was closely involved with meat hygiene and public health and in the late-1930s he was in Birkenhead and Holyhead inspecting imported Irish cattle. In February-March 1960 Elmslie took part in a British government vist to Kenya along with Mr. A. D. J. Brennan to determine the possibilities for the import of Kenyan beef into the UK.'
