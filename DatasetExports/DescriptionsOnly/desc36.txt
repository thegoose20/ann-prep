'This broadside is addressed toEdinburghand is dated 29 November 1720. The name Jo. Wightman, Baillie, J.P. appears at the bottom of the ordinance. There is a woodcut initial at the beginning of the text.'


"Until the mid-19th century, broadsides provided the sort of information provided by modern tabloids. They tended to be single sheets of paper, unfolded, and printed on one side. Designed to be posted up in public places, broadsides were used for the printing of royal proclamations, acts, and official notices, and later on became a means of political agitation. Edinburgh's 'baillies', the officials responsible for this notice or broadside, were the city's magistrates who had administrative and judicial powers. In Scotland the office of 'baillie', also spelled 'bailie', emerged in the 14th century. Since 1975, the title has largely become a courtesy one. Those baillies present when this ordinance was issued in Edinburgh in November 1720 were: John Wightman, George Preston, Robert Grierson, and Hugh Hathorn. They were present as Baillies and Justices of His Majesty's Peace. The ordinance was intended to restrain the soldiers of the City Guard from the 'immoral practices of Cursing and Swearing'. Those who were caught would be fined one penny and the money put into the poor box."
