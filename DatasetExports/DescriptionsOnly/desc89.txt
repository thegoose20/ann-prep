"Rossdhu near Luss, on Loch Lomond, is a Georgian house and ruined mediaeval castle of the Chiefs of the Clan Colquhoun. 'Ros dubh' is Gaelic for the 'Black Headland'. The Colquhoun Baronetcy, of Luss, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 27 June 1786 for James Colquhoun. The fourth, fifth and seventh Baronets all served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dumbartonshire. Sir James Colquhoun 26th of Luss - a friend and correspondent of Horace Walpole - was a connoisseur and collector of paintings, landscapes in particular, engravings, ancient coins and rare old china. Sir James Colquhoun (born 1804), the 28th Chief (4th Baronet), was drowned in Loch Lomond in 1873."
