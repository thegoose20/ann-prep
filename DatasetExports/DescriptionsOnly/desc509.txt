"The pair of letters from Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) make reference to Helen Walker (d. 1791) who had become the fictional Jeanie Deans, a character in his novel The Heart of Midlothian. In a letter to Walter Dickson, 27 October 1827, Scott refers to Dickson's mother-in-law, Mrs Goldie - Helen Goldie (nee Lawson) (1752-1829) - and the 'anonymous favour' provided by the content of a letter. This enabled him 'to produce to the public the efficient and interesting character of Jeanie Deans' as he had 'christened her most respectable friend Helen Walker'.Scott erected a monument at Helen Walker's grave in the parish of Irongray, about six miles from Dumfries, and his letter to the Rev. Dr. Anthony Dow, 5 March 1830, indicates his intention to erect this 'simple monument'."
