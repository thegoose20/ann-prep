'The collection is composed of circa 28 letters to the Secretary of the Scots Law Society, William Lindsay, and A. Thomson Jnr.'


"In 1819 the Presidents of the Scots Law Society were Messrs. James Robertson, Robert Ellis, and David Houston. The Secretary was James Knox. Into the mid-nineteenth century, William Lindsay of Bernard Street, Leith, and a little later on A. Thomson Jnr., held the post of Secretary. The Scots Law Society was also sometimes referred to as the Scots Law Society College. The Society publishedLaw cases and speculative questions for the discussion of the Scots Law Society. This was printed by Oliver and Boyd, High Street, Edinburgh. Some of the issues speculated over in March 1827 were: Would it be expedient to introduce the practice of the Coroner's Inquests to this country? Is their a standard of Taste? Is Duelling in any circumstances justifiable? Can Machinery ever be so extensively employed as to become prejudicial to a country? and Is there a moral sense?"
