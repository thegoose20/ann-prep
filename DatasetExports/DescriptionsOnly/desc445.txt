'This is a collection of 12 very vividly water-coloured drawings (280 x 180 mm) depicting scenes of punishments and executions. They have been done on Chinese rice paper held in place by a light blue silk ribbon border. The binding is covered in contemporary decorated silk. Done probably in Canton (Guangzhou), circa 1850.'


'Chinese watercolours were produced in the port cities of China for sale and export to Western customers in the late-18th and 19th centuries. Subjects covered such subjects as figure drawings, the crafts of tea growing and porcelain-making, topographical views, bird and flower painting, and the slightly more unusual. These had a considerable influence on the estern image of China.'
