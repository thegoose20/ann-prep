'Content Description This ms scrapbook volume of E. M. G. Colquhoun is dated, Edinburgh, 17 September 1838, at the top of a preface. The volume is in two parts; the whole item containing anecdotes, stories, poems, music and pen and ink illustrations of monuments, seals, antiques, animals, and characters.From the beginning of the scrapbook, written by Colquhoun on the 17th of September 1838: "It had always been my chief wish, from my childhood upwards, that I might have a scrap-book of my own, to be filled with selections in prose and verse. ...Having some spare time, ...about two years ago, I again thought of beginning a new scrap-book, and as I was devotedly fond of drawing, I thought that I might use this book as a sort of sketch book, where I might both improve myself in my favourite amusement, and at the same time illustrate the subjects I copied, by making pen-and-ink drawings, in my own rough way, to accompany them. These drawings are all copied from engravings, and I trust that my inexperience in the art will be a sufficient apology for the rude style in which they are executed. After having continued these extracts and drawings for about a year, circumstances came in the way, which prevented me from continuing them, and I was obliged to gather some of my old compilations together, that I might have a sufficient quantity of material to make a volume. This is the origin of my "scrap-book", and I trust that it will be found on perusal as amusing as other books of the same sort."Part 1 contains: 140pp of historical documentary articles, curiosities compiled from travelling around Britain and Europe.Part 2 contains: poems, prose articles, and some music.Throughout both parts there are fine pen/ink illustrations.'
