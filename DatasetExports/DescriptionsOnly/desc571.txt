"Content Description This letter from John Buchan to Professor Herbert J. C. Grierson was written from Elsfield Manor, Oxford, 7 March 1928. It is addressed to Grierson at his home on Regent Terrace, Edinburgh.The letter refers to Buchan's work on James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose. The Duke of Montrose had sent him verses 'which he believes were written by the Great Marquis'. He had gotten them from 'some old book which he cannot now identify, and in which they were so attributed'.Buchan wonders if Grierson, with his 'great knowledge of seventeenth century poetry' could offer him a clue."
