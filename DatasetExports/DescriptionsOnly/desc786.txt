"Timothy Lauro Squire Sprigge was born in London on 14 January 1932. His father, Cecil Jackson Squire Sprigge (1896-1959), was the chief correspondent for Reuters in Italy between 1943 and 1953. The elder Sprigge translated some of the work of Benedetto Croce, the Italian philosopher, and also wrote biographies of Croce and Karl Marx. The younger Sprigge attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, between 1952 and 1959. He had studied English and then transferred to Moral Sciences. He spent the last two years of his studies and research for a Cambridge Ph.D. at University College London (UCL) where in 1959 he worked on the manuscripts of Jeremy Bentham. In 1961 he submitted his dissertation entitledThe limits of morals definedand was awarded the degree of Ph.D. (Cantab). On 4 April 1959, Sprigge married Giglia Gordon. In 1961 Sprigge took up a post as a temporary Lecturer in Philosophy at UCL, and later on in the 1960s was a Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Sussex where he became Reader in 1970. From 1979 and for the next ten years he held the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh. Between 1989 and 1997 he was Emeritus Professor at Edinburgh University, and Endowment Fellow. After 1997 he was Emeritus Professor and Honorary Fellow. Sprigge was President of the Aristotelian Society, 1991-1992, and in 1993 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
