"Sir Thomas Hope, 1st Baronet, Craighall, (1573–1646) was a Scottish lawyer. He was admitted as an advocate in 1605, and he made his reputation by defending John Forbes (1568?-1634), and other ministers at Linlithgow in 1606. In 1625, he prepared the deed revoking the grants of church property made by James VI. Hope was appointed Lord Advocate in 1626, and held the office until 1641. He was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia in 1628. Hope conducted the case against John Elphinstone, 2nd Lord Balmerino in 1634. As Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1643, he maintained the king's temporizing policy. In 1645 Hope was appointed one of the Commissioners for managing the Exchequer, but died the following year. Sir Thomas Hope of Kerse (1606–1643) was a Scottish judge and politician. He was the second son of Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall. Hope was prominent in opposing Charles I's demand for a public inquiry into 'The Incident' which was a Royalist plot to kidnap a group of Scottish nobles in October 1641 during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms."
