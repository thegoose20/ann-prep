"One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. Hancock and Beatty continued to collaborate in and correspond about this work after Hancock moved to the University of Bristol. Hancock published 'Comparisons of effects of normal rabbit sera and anti-cock sperm sera on rabbit sperm, including comparison of effects on the sex ratio' in Biology of Reproduction, 18:510-515 (1978).", 'Upon receiving the grant, Beatty was initially engaged with recruiting an immunologist to work on antibodies in mammalian spermatozoa. After some difficulties in finding a suitable candidate, Abraham Kulangara was appointed as a Research Assistant in 1965. In 1967, Beatty and Anne McLaren applied for another Ford Foundation grant under the Physiology of Reproduction Program to enable them to continue their work.', "Beatty began his PhD at the Zoology and Biochemistry Departments, Cambridge, in 1938, but because of the interruption of war he did not submit the two parts of his thesis until 1949.

It was a Sub-Committee of the University Works and Buildings Committee and existed to co-ordinate the interests of the various bodies connected with the proposed Centre for Reproductive Biology (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical Research Council and the Ford Foundation), each of which had different planning and approval procedures. On the second meeting of the Sub-Committee, it was agreed that a Users Group should also be formed to act as informal working party for the co-ordination of the accommodation and other requirements of the several interests in the project.', "In October 1976 the Ford Foundation approved an extension of Beatty and McLaren's third grant up to March 1978, permitting the payment of unexpended funds and the completion of the research.", "The Symposium was sponsored by Colorado State University and the American Institute of Biological Sciences and took place at Colorado State University. At the Symposium, Beatty gave a paper titled 'Gynogenesis in Vertebrates: Fertilisation by Genetically Inactivated Spermatozoa.'", "In 1974 Anne McLaren relocated to University College London to direct the Medical Research Council's Mammalian Development Unit, although she continued to utilise the Ford Foundation's funding there.", "Vojtiskova had conducted work on mouse spermatozoa in the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics for a fixed period in April 1968 as a Post-Doctoral Fellow salaried from Beatty's Ford Foundation grant.", 'This refers to research carried out by R.A Beatty and Allan Templeton, as part of an investigation into the presence of F-bodies as possible Y-chromosome markers in mature sperm heads. See also /1/8.', "At the Conference, Beatty gave a paper on 'Sex Ratio Control: What are the Prospects?'", "In a letter to the Ford Foundation on 20 January 1977, Beatty gave his reasons for deciding to withdraw from the Centre: 'It has recently become apparent that the projected completion date for the Reproductive Biology Building will be late 1979 or early 1980. I retire in April 1980 and it no longer makes sense for me to think of moving into the new building. It would be more realistic for me to withdraw now and make way for the finding of some alternative group to occupy the accommodation earmarked for me.'", "At the Conference, Beatty took part in the panel sessions 'Physiology of the uterus and cervix', 'Normal and teratologic development' and 'The Male'.", 'Beatty was appointed to the Senior Lalor Fellow at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, for the 1964 summer session.', "Fechheimer spent three sabbatical periods in Beatty's research group in the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics: in 1959, 1970 and 1977, when he was awarded a Fellowship funded under the Ford Foundation grant.", "The theme of the Symposium was 'Physiologic and Genetic Aspects of Reproduction'.

His PhD was awarded in 1950.', 'The Symposium was sponsored by American Society of Animal Science, University of Illinois.', "The Centre for Reproductive Biology stemmed from a proposal made to the University in October 1970 by David T. Baird, Beatty and Anne McLaren in association with Richard V. Short. They argued for the establishment of a multidisciplinary centre for reproductive biology in Edinburgh, in recognition of the increasing role of reproductive biology in medical, agricultural and social problems. Additional impetus was provided when the Medical Research Council invited medical schools throughout Britain to compete for the establishment of a new Unit of Reproductive Biology. The Centre was to incorporate the existing MRC Unit of Reproductive Biology and the independent University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The Centre was housed in a newly constructed building on a site made available by the Regional Hospital Board at the Royal Infirmary, partially with a grant of £266,000 from the Ford Foundation. The delay in the building's completion meant that Beatty was close to retiring by the time of its opening, so in 1977 he withdrew from the Centre. The Centre was commissioned in July 1979 and was officially opened a year later by Simone Veil.", 'Between 1963 and 1972, Beatty and Anne McLaren received four large grants from the Ford Foundation for the study of genetics and the physiology of reproduction. To carry out this work, Beatty and McLaren formed two separate research groups within the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics within the Institute of Animal Genetics.', 'At the Congress, Beatty chaired the Symposium on Embryonic and Perinatal Mortality.', 'The Fifth International Chromosome Conference was held in the Gorlaeus Laboratory of the University of Leiden, the Netherlands.', "The Symposium was jointly hosted by the Society for the Study of Fertility and the British Society for Developmental Biology. At the Symposium, Beatty delivered a paper titled 'Gamete differentiation in relation to genetic content.'", 'In 1967, Beatty and Anne McLaren applied jointly for a contination grant from the Ford Foundation to enable them to continue their work in Gamete Genetics (Beatty) and Reproductive Physiology (Anne McLaren) in the Reproductive Genetics Section. This application proved successful, and in July 1967, a grant of $151,000 was awarded to the University of Edinburgh to Beatty and Anne McLaren for a five year period in continued support of research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction. In 1971 the Ford Foundation suggested that Beatty and McLaren make an application for a second grant renewal before the expiry of the current grant.', "At the Congress, Beatty gave a paper 'Spontaneous chromosomal anomalies causing early embryonic death in mammals.'", 'The Colloquium was held at the University of Basel, Switzerland.', "At the Symposium, Beatty gave a paper, 'Genetics of Animal Spermatozoa'.", "Beatty and Fredga submitted their joint article 'Sperm F-bodies in man and their absence in three primates and twenty-one other mammals' (short title: 'Absence of sperm F-bodies in some mammals') in 1977 for publication in Cytogenetics and Cell Genetics Review Forum, but it was rejected. They went on to redraft the article in 1978 for submission to the Journal of Reproductive Fertility.", "Marta Vojtiskova joined the Institute in April 1968 as a Post-Doctoral Fellow salaried from the Grant, working on mouse spermatozoa. Vojtiskova's paper 'Presence of H-2d antigens in mouse spermatozoa' was published in Nature, 222:1293-4 and 'Histocompatibility antigens on mouse spermatozoa' was published in Folia Biologica,15(5):322-32, both in 1969. Kulangara's paper 'Individual Patterns of Ram Seminal Antigens' was published in the Journal of Immunology, 102:6, 1445-1453 (01 June 1969). R.S Mathur joined in October 1969 for a nine month period, studying the enzymes of spermatozoa. A.D Carothers was a Research Associate at the Institute from October 1972 to February 1975 and Robert E. Denell was a Visiting Fellow from 1972 to 1973.", "At the Symposium, Beatty gave a paper 'Organisation and activation of the mammalian genome.'", "Robert G. Edwards studied in Beatty's research group in the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics and received his PhD in 1955. The correspondence here, however, covers the period when Edwards was based in Cambridge as a Ford Foundation Research Fellow at the Department of Physiology and, in collaboration with Patrick Steptoe, was conducting work on fertilising human eggs in a laboratory. This work on in vitro fertilisation (IVF), which in 1978 would lead to the birth of the first 'test-tube baby', gained Edwards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010, but at the time led to much hostility, opposition and legal controversy.", "One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. As an invention which could separate male- and female- determining spermatozoa was potentially of wider commercial interest, a patent was applied for by Beatty to protect this work (known as 'Control of Sex Ratio in Mammalian Offspring') before Hancock submitted his results for publication. In 1976, funding was also received from the Scottish Milk Marketing Board to determine whether the sex-ratio control method could be applicable in cattle. A United States Patent Application was also put forward in 1977.", "At the meeting, Beatty gave a paper 'Heterospermic Insemination and Sire Fertility.'", 'David Baird, R.A Beatty and Anne McLaren, in collaboration with Roger Short, made the submission to the Medical Research Council on Obstetrics and Gynaecology for the establishment of a Centre for Reproductive Biology in Edinburgh in 1971, following an circular letter from the Medical Research Council to all medical schools in Britain.', 'David Baird, Beatty, Anne McLaren and Roger Short submitted a list to the Rockefeller Foundation of equipment required for the Centre for Reproductive Biology', "At the Congress, Beatty was co-chairman for a section on 'General Animal Genetics' and gave a paper titled 'The spermatozoa of mouse strains selected for body weight.'", "The Symposium was hosted by the Animal Breeding Research Organisation at the Institute of Animal Genetics. At the Symposium, Beatty delivered a paper on 'Sex Determination.'", 'In 1971 the Ford Foundation suggested that Beatty and McLaren make an application for a second grant renewal before the expiry of the second grant, due to expire on 31 July 1972. The application for the continuation grant of $307,500 for three years for was submitted in September 1971 and approved in March 1972.', "In May 1960, Solly Zuckerman approached Waddington on behalf of the Ford Foundation, who wished to stimulate research into the physiology of reproduction. Waddington replied putting forward the names of Beatty and Anne McLaren as best placed for taking this research opportunity further. An application was submitted to the Ford Foundation in August 1960, but it appears that nothing further occurred until February 1963, when Professor Emil Witschi (consultant to the Ford) approached Waddington about potential Ford Foundation support for work in population control. An application was submitted and proved successful: in July 1963, the Ford Foundation awarded the University of Edinburgh a grant of $40,000 over a four-year period for research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction by R.A Beatty and Anne McLaren within the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics at the Institute of Animal Genetics. The grant partly funded four new laboratory rooms and a building known as 'the Ford Hut' at the Institute.", "The Colloquium was held in the Department of Anatomy at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Beatty and R.G Edwards took part in a discussion on 'the sex ratio at conception...'", 'The conference was organised by the Population Council, Inc and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. It took place in the Hotel Thayer, West Point, New York.', 'Abraham C. Kulangara was a Research Associate in the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics from 1965-1968, working on spermatozoan immunology with funds from the Ford Foundation. At the time of this correspondence, Kulangara was based in the United States at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'The report was compiled by David Baird.', "At the meeting, Beatty gave a paper 'Control of the sex ratio in mammals with special reference to man.'", "The grant of $307,500 to fund Beatty and McLaren's research groups was due to extend until March 1978, although Beatty requested that the unexpended balance on this grant be extended until October 1980 to extend the funding of the PhD student Avril Sutherland until after the period of Beatty's retirement in April 1980.", 'Beatty was interested in investigating whether certain aspects of chromosome structure and spermatozoan morphology are stable by examining a sample from the testis of a mummified human. He was able to obtain samples from both a mummified human and a dog from the British Museum (Natural History) in December 1977.', 'This refers to research carried out by R.A Beatty and Allan Templeton, as part of an investigations into the presence of F-bodies as possible Y-chromosome markers in mature sperm heads.
