An extensive case-history dated Edinburgh, March 1830, is written in the first person. Inserted between pp.36-37 is a visiting card of 'Rev'd John Ainslie / Dirleton' and elsewhere in the volume is a loosely inserted ruled sheet for keeping the pages regular. 1 x common-place book, small 4to, filled to the extent of only som 30pp or so, largely unnumbered. Binding is half dark green morocco. Titled on the spine as 'Hints on Gardening'. Entries dated 1828-1836, not confined to horticulture but extend to agriculture including notes on sheep-breeding.

'Commonplace books (or commonplaces) were a way of compiling knowledge, usually by writing information into books. The books were, in effect, scrapbooks filled with items such as medical recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables, proverbs, prayers, legal and mathematical formulas. Commonplaces were used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts that had been learned. Every commonplace book was unique to the particular interests of the creator. In this instance, the commonplace books concern themselves with notes about medical receipts and prescriptions, and gardening hints.'
