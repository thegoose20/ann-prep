He believes the paper to be easily accessible to the layman and suggests publishing it in The Field and The Livestock. The end of the letter appears to be wanting.', "Ewart writes that the account for the sheep from Cheltenham has already been paid. He tells Elwes to make a note of anything interesting on his travels, and if Elwes is back by March they may meet at the Zoological Congress in Monte Carlo. He reports that Elwes' two fat-rumped sheep and a dozen more ewes seem to be in lamb to the fat-tailed ram, and that the cloth Elwes sent is much admired. Now that Ewart's lectures are over for the winter he hopes to get some writing done.", "Correspondence chiefly concerns Ewart's appointment to the Swiney Lectureship at the British Museum for 1907, the sale of ponies to the Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey (and related correspondence with the estate) and the sale of ponies belonging to Alexander McHardy and Lord Arthur Cecil. Ewart's main publications in this year deal with coat colour in horses, inbreeding in the Barbary Sheep and the common goat and the horse skulls discovered at the Roman fort in Newstead, near Melrose, Scotland.", 'Fairbairn describes the difficulties in getting Australian produce to prominence, partly due to the competition with American advertisers. He invites Mrs Ewart to visit him in London before he departs for Australia.', 'R. du Bois-Reymond thanks Ewart for sending a copy of his Penycuik Experiments. He discusses the position of veterinary surgeons in Germany and the qualifications that they can take. The writer cites the views of a Professor Mank, his superior, that the standing of the veterinarian is not viewed as being at the same level as that of a doctor, and in order for this to change their preparatory training would have to be the same. The major obstacle to this happening in Germany are the landowners who believe that they can deal more easily with men of lower social standing.', "Alexander writes that he accepts the Duke of Bedford's offer.

She asks if Ewart would like her to talk to Lord Onslow about his remaining herd of mountain zebras.

She complains about the lack of funding for scientific research.", "Fetherstonhaugh answers Ewart's enquiry about his dun mare and confirms that he purchased her from County Carlow. He writes that he is enclosing two photographs (not present) showing the markings on the mare.", "Cecil thanks Ewart for updating him on news of the development of the foal 'Romulus', particularly the changes in the colour of its coat. He describes a pony stallion called Lord Ronald that his father once bought 'of the same breed as my stallion Highland Laddie years and years ago but no-one can trace it ever going to Rum.' He also remarks 'what you say about artificial fertilisation is most interesting and I am awaiting news of your Faroe Iceland pony most anxiously'.", 'Jones confirms that Penicuik Town Council has granted Ewart permission to connect a lead service pipe to the water main supplying the houses in the Bog Road with water on condition that Ewart maintains the pipe.', 'Drummond-Hay writes that she wishes she could meet the Ewarts in person to hear about their time in New Zealand, as an uncle of hers once lived there.

He hopes Ewart will visit him when next in London.', "Lord Stewart-Murray, who signs himself 'Tullibardine', says he can either send his pure-bred Arab pony to Edinburgh or he could put Ewart's mares up at his residence, Dunkeld House, Dunkeld. He gives instructions for the care of the pony when he is with Ewart, and asks that Ewart keep an account of the mares the pony serves.", 'Butcher writes that he is sorry he did not see Ewart on his recent visit to Connemara.

He gives details about a three year old cream-coloured pony in his local district and about a horse of his own.', 'Lankester presses Ewart to reply to his letters and send him his paper on the embryonic development of the horse.

He considers that Ewart does not emphasise the importance of breeding in telegony tests from pairs of animals of the same colour as well as the same breed. He believes it a shame that he has given so long a list of suggested experiments, as the greater the variety of single experiments, the less their cumulative effect. He gives advice on the procedures he should adopt for the hybridisation of animals, and, tells an anecdotal story to illustrate the theory of 'the influence of mental impressions of the mother on the offspring'.", 'Elwes asks Ewart to come and see him if he is going to visit Sir Claud Alexander.

He comments that he would be delighted to exchange instead, but that he is afraid of the suspicion of his colleagues.', "Ewart is not directly addressed as a recipient in the letter.

Professor Noack explains that he has reported him to the public prosecutor.", "Muntz asks Ewart's advice on the best book relating to the question of colour (in breeding) of animals, particularly the horse.

The latter part of the letter, including author's signature, is not present.", 'Leach thanks Ewart for the book on the development of the horse. He wonders why mares even after foaling do not get stinted so easily in cold weather as in mild, and why maiden mares do not come into season or get in foal until the end of March or early April and postulates that the cold retards development.', "Elwes writes that he has heard that the sheep at Greystoke will be transported once the restrictions in Peebles are lifted.

He offers to submit a draft of a condensed version of the article for Ewart's approval, and believes the Board of Trade would print and circulate it. Author's signature is unclear.", "Ewart thanks Elwes for the wool samples and the details about the Austrian Skemschaf.

He thinks that his knowledge of the Achaen horse would be of interest to Ewart, as he believes them to be the same as both the small horses of Northern Britain in the time of Caesar, and those of the Danube area. He discusses the spread of the horse into Africa. He agrees that the Somali zebra and the North African horse are probably strands of the same species. Regarding the assertions of Louis Capitan and Henri Breuil regarding two breeds of horses shown at the Combarelles caves, Ridgeway has serious reservations.
