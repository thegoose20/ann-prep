"Content Description Donaldson's School (now located in Linlithgow, West Lothian) was founded in 1851 and was originally housed in the Donaldson's Hospital Building in West Coates, Edinburgh. The school and building had been financed by Sir James Donaldson (1751â€“1830), who was sometime publisher of the Edinburgh Advertiser a city newspaper (1764-1859) which later merged with the Edinburgh Evening Courant.Applications to the School on behalf of deaf children were encouraged, and from 1938 pupils were exclusively deaf. In 1938, the Royal Institute for Deaf and Dumb, Edinburgh (founded in 1824), was merged into Donaldson's School.The A-listed Donaldson's Hospital building was designed by architect William Henry Playfair in the Gothic style inspired by Elizabethan manor houses. The building is built round a quadrangle in Tudor architecture style with large corner towers which themselves are each made up of four smaller towers. The Hospital was opened by Queen Victoria in 1850.The new Donaldson's campus opened in Linlithgow in January 2008."
