"The collection is composed of 5 menu cards from the Annual Dinners of the Edinburgh University Forestry Society for the years 1929-1932 - the years covering the course followed by James Robert Thom - and for 1954. The latter was 25 years after Thom's first year at University. The cards for 1929 and 1932 are heavily autographed, and the card for 1931 notes that J. R. Thom was the Chairman which meant that he was required to propose a toast to 'the guests' during the 1931 Annual Dinner. Between 1929 and 1932 the dinners were held at the Royal Hotel, Princes Street, Edinburgh, and in 1954 at the George Hotel, George Street, Edinburgh."


"James Robert Thom was born in Kirckcaldy, Fife, on 22 July 1910. He received his schooling at Kirkcaldy High School, 1915-1919, and then at George Watson's Boys' College, Edinburgh, between 1920 and 1928. He then studied Forestry at Edinburgh University, commencing in October 1928, and was awarded the degree of B.Sc. (Forestry), 1932. He is believed to have become prominent in the field, in Canada."
