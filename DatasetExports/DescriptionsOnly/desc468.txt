"In December 1988, Lothian Regional Council (LRC) and Lothian Health Board (LHB) announced the formation of a new body, the Waverley Care Trust. Responsibility for the organisation of Trust meetings rested with the Regional Secretary's Department and trustees included the Lord Provost of the City of Edinburgh, the Chairman of Lothian Health Board and the Bishop of Edinburgh. Waverley Care Trust, working with the Milestone Venture Trust, was responsible for the establishment of a residential care facility for people with HIV and AIDS called Milestone House, which opened in 1991 in the grounds of the City Hospital. In 1993, the SOLAS Information and Resource Centre, which had previously been run as an independent organisation, became a sister project of Milestone House, offering a community space for those affected by HIV to obtain information and support. In the following years, the Waverley Care Arts Project was jointly administered by SOLAS and Milestone, with art-based activities being delivered in both locations. Another key function was added in 1996, with the establishment of the Buddy Service, which offered the opportunity for those affected by HIV and AIDS to receive one-on-one support from trained volunteers. In July 2003, the organisation was incorporated as a Company limited by guarantee under the name Waverley Care. Waverley Care's organisational remit expanded to include all blood-borne viruses, formally acknowledging the increased work Waverley Care was doing with those diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Geographically, the charity also broadened its scope in the 2000s: 2005 saw the African Health Project being delivered in Glasgow from a new office in the city, while in 2007, the first national project was launched in the form of an outreach and support initiative for children across Scotland affected by HIV. The work of Waverley Care was extended to Lanarkshire, Fife and the Borders in 2009, and then to the Highland area and Argyll and Bute the following year, with a new office being opened in Inverness.", 'Following the closure of premises then operating as the Gateway Exchange, an arts and social centre for former prisoners, drug addicts and alcoholics, the buildings at 2/4 Abbeymount were offered to Lothian Regional Council in 1988 as a potential HIV and AIDS information and resource centre. The council commissioned a three-month feasibility study assessing the need for such a centre, which concluded that there was both demand and wide-ranging local support for the idea. Taking its name from the Gaelic word for light, the SOLAS HIV and AIDS Resource Centre was constituted in February 1989 and formally registered as a charity in May of that year. The appointment of a Development Worker and an Administrative Worker in November 1989 facilitated the implementation of the project and, after significant renovation, the building officially opened in November 1991. SOLAS became a sister project of Milestone House under the banner of Waverley Care Trust on 1 Nov 1993. Key services offered at the centre included a café, a play facility, an information centre, a range of complementary therapies, and bookable rooms for support groups, meetings and social events.', 'Milestone House officially opened in January 1991, and the first resident was admitted on 18 February 1991. Situated in the grounds of the City Hospital, Edinburgh, though administered independently of the NHS, Milestone House was established to offer convalescence, terminal care and respite care for people with HIV or AIDS. At the point of opening, Milestone House comprised four bungalows, each with three single rooms, one double room and one guest room, as well as a shared central social space. By 1999, the services offered at Milestone House had adapted to reflect the positive effects of new drug treatments and combination therapy, with an increased focus on respite care rather than palliative and terminal care.'
