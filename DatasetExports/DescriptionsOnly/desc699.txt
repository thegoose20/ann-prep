"Robert Maxwell MacBrair, M.A., was a Wesleyan missionary in the Gambia. He arrived in the Gambia circa 1836 on a special mission to write a grammar of the Mandingo and Foolah languages and to provide a translation service. He found the climate unfavourable and soon returned to England. With the assistance of an African who had returned with him, MacBrair completed his task of compiling a grammar,The Mandingo Grammar, and a translation of the New Testament. He also wroteSketches of a Missionary's Travels."
