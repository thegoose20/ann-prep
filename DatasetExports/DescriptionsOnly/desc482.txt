"Rev. Ralph Wardlaw, D.D. was a Scottish Presbyterian clergyman and writer. He was born in Dalkeith on 22 December 1779. His family had a strong connection to the Secession Church but shortly after his University studies were complete Wardlaw turned to Independent Congregationalism. He was ordained in 1803, and was successful as a preacher. By 1811 he and Rev. Greville Ewing founded Glasgow's first academy for congregationalist theology students. Wardlaw strongly influenced David Livingstone, who attended his lectures in divinity, and was inspired by his campaigns against slavery to fight the African slave trade during his years as a missionary and explorer. Rev. Ralph Wardlaw died on 15 December 1853. He is buried in the Glasgow Necropolis, near Glasgow Cathedral."
