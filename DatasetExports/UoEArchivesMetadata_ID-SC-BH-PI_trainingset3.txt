{"Madeira was claimed by Portuguese sailors in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1419, and settled after 1420. The island's viticulture was introduced by the Portuguese in the early 15th century and by 1455 its vines were finest sight in the world, according to the Venetian traveller Alvise da Mosto. Even so, for the next 200 years the principal occupation was the growing of sugar-cane. Wines produced on the island were consumed by islanders themselves. Vineyards would replace sugar-cane during the latter part of the seventeenth century however, and the export of wine would become Madeira's chief source of revenue. The island exported wine to the West Indies, North America and to India, largely on English vessels. The bulk of the exported wine from Madeira was ordinary beverage red wine, drunk before it was a year old. Ordinary beverage white wine was also produced from the verdelho grape, and a small quantity of dark red wine was made from the negra molle grape. This latter wine, also called Tinto or Tent, was mostly used for blending with red wines which were too light in colour. During the War of the Spanish Succession in the reign of Queen Anne there was disruption to shipping from Madeira. The merchant William Bolton took the initiative of distilling some of the surplus wine still in the hands of growers, and later on this brandy was added to wines in order to make them last. In Britain, Madeira wine began to be really popular."}

{"Barry Cambray Bloomfield was born on 1 June 1931 in East London. He was educated at East Ham Grammar School and, during wartime evacuation, in Exeter. He was awarded the degree of MA in Librarianship at University College, London. In the 1950s he served with British Intelligence Corps in Malaya. His library career included periods at: the National Central Library (which would become a part of the British Library); the College of St. Mark and St. John, Exeter; the LSE and SOAS; the India Office; and, the British Library. He retired in 1990. Bloomfield's Master's thesis was a bibliography of the works of W. H. Auden which went to publication as W. H. Auden, a bibliography: the early years through 1955 (1964). Collaborating with Edward Mendelson (b. 1946), Bloomfield published a greatly expanded 2nd edition of the bibliography in 1972, and the newer work carried the bibliographical record up to 1969. He also compiled Philip Larkin, a bibliography 1933-1976, (1979) Barry Cambray Bloomfield died in Wye, Kent, on 26 February 2002. Professor Edward Mendelson is the literary executor of the Estate of W. H. Auden and he has also written and edited several books about Auden's work including Early Auden (1981) and Later Auden (1999). Mendelson was the first holder of the Isabel Dalhousie Fellowship at Edinburgh's Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH) in 2012. During this Fellowship he delivered a lecture on Auden and the Flesh We Are at St Cecilia's Hall. Professors Edward and Cheryl Mendelson were joint holders of the Isabel Dalhousie Fellowship at IASH in 2014.

{"The first use of paper has been excavated in China dating to the 2nd century BC. It was used for the purposes of wrapping or padding protection for delicate bronze mirrors. It was also used for the padding of poisonous medicines and potions. By the 3rd century AD, the use of paper for writing became widespread. In the period of the Tang Dynasty paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of tea, and the the government of the Song Dynasty produced the world's first known paper-printed money. After its origin in central China, the production and use of paper spread steadily, to Japan, to the Middle East and to Europe."}

{"This preliminary draft of the 1955 PhD thesis (University of Pennsylvania) entitled The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory by Noam Chomsky (b. 1928) - and published 1975 - had been in the possession of Professor Angus McIntosh (1914-2005). Angus McIntosh was born near Sunderland on 10 January 1914. He was educated at Ryhope Grammar School and he studied at Oriel College, Oxford. There he took first-class honours in English in 1934. As a Harmsworth scholar, he went on to a Diploma in Comparative Philology at Merton College. After a period at Harvard as a Commonwealth fellow (1936-38), he took up a lectureship in the English department at University College Swansea. After a short spell in the Tank Corps during the Second World War, McIntosh served as a Major in military intelligence, at Bletchley. Experience there influenced his thinking about the potential of computers as a tool for linguistic analysis. After the war, he returned to a lectureship at Christ Church, Oxford, before going on to Edinburgh University. Here, he became the prime mover in the founding of the School of Epistemics (now Informatics) and the School of Scottish Studies, out of the separate Departments of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics. He was also behind two major dictionary projects and the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. Indeed, while assessing returns from the survey questionnaire that McIntosh began to see the possibility of applying the methodology of modern dialect surveys to the investigation of past stages of the language. His experiements, and those of his collaborators, would revolutionise dialect research in historical linguistics. His pioneering work for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland resulted in the publication of the Introduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects (1952).

Durie's bailies are ordered without delay to place John Edmonstone in corporeal possession of the inheritance, estate and seisin of the property. It recites the free surrender by John Edmonstone, as to the lord of the fee, by rod and staff (per fustum et baculum) as is the custom; grant in fee farm to John Edmonstone of Edmonstone and his wife Euphemia Wauchope and the longer liver in joint fee, and to their heirs male, remainder to any of John's heirs bearing the name and arms of Edmonstone, remainder to John's next lawful heirs.

{"George Durie, born around 1496, was from 1527 until 1530 judge and executor of Arbroath Abbey. During this same period he assumed the title Commendator, in effect the Abbot, of Dunfermline Abbey. He sat in Parliament and was a Lord of Council (one of the Lords of Articles). In 1539 he was a member of the group convened by David Beaton (1494-1596) to battle heresy in Scotland, and he participated in several notable heresy trials. He was also involved in the formulation of military policy and travelled to France on government matters in 1541. He returned to France in in 1561, remaining there until 1570. He died in October 1577. Durie is particularly remembered as an administrator, and a document - a precept of seisin - of 1 February 1544 records the transfer of possession of the 'Lie Mains of Edmonstone' to John Edmonstone of Edmonstone and his wife Euphemia Wauchope. His agents, or bailies, William Boge and John Trulle, had been authorised to give possession. Sasine (in Scottish law), or seisin, is the delivery, or transfer of possession, of feudal property, typically land. A land proprietor might authorise his or her agent or factor to give possession of a property to someone else through a document known as a 'precept of sasine'. Over time, 'sasine' has come to refer to the deed or document recording the transfer, rather than to the transfer itself."}

He was educated privately by the music and general teacher Miss Sophie Weisse (1851-1945), and later on won a music scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, graduating with a BA, Classical honours, in 1898. As a pianist, a series of chamber music concerts followed in London, Berlin and Vienna where he played with Halle, Joachim, Hausmann, Casals, and other artists. He also composed. In 1914 he was appointed to the Reid Chair of Music at Edinburgh University. Tovey also established and conducted the Reid Orchestra and organised an annual series of concerts. His musical compositions were in many forms including chamber music, symphony, grand opera and concerto, and probably the most famous was his opera 'The bride of Dionysus' produced in Edinburgh in 1929. His literary publications include the six volumes of 'Essays in musical analysi's (1935-1939), and 'A musician talks' (1941). Tovey was knighted in 1935. Sir Donald Francis Tovey died on 10 July 1940. Pablo (Pau) Casals was born in El Vendrell, Catalonia, on 29 December 1876. He would become a cellist and conductor, and is generally regarded as the pre-eminent cellist of the first half of the 20th century, and one of the greatest cellists of all time. He made many recordings throughout his career, of solo, chamber, and orchestral music, also as conductor, but he is perhaps best remembered for the recordings of the Bach Cello Suites he made from 1936 to 1939. Casals was an ardent supporter of the Spanish Republican government, and after its defeat vowed not to return to Spain until democracy was restored. Casals performed at the Gran Teatre del Liceu on 19 October 1938, possibly his last performance in Catalonia before his exile. He died in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 22 October 1973, and was buried at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery. In 1979 his remains were interred in his hometown of El Vendrell, Catalonia."}

{"Andrew Duncan was born at Pinkerton, near St. Andrews on 17 October 1744. His father was a merchant and shipmaster at Crail and then St. Andrews. The young Andrew was educated in Crail and then in St. Andrews, and he studied at St. Andrews University obtaining an M.A. in 1762. That same year he entered Edinburgh University as a medical student. During his studies, in 1764, he became President of the Royal Medical Society. On completion of his studies in 1768, Duncan went to China as a ship's surgeon for the East India Company. On his return in 1769 he graduated with the degree of M.D. at St. Andrews University. In 1770, he became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, and the same year he tried unsuccessfully for a professorship in St. Andrews. However, when Dr. Drummond the elected-Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh University fell ill, during his absence Duncan was appointed to lecture there from 1774. When Drummond failed to return, he was elected Professor. Duncan then began a public dispensary which later became the Royal Public Dispensary. In 1789, he was appointed to the Chair of the Institutes of Medicine (physiology) and in 1790 he became President of the Royal College of Physicians. Moved by the death of the poet Robert Ferguson (1750-1774), Duncan was instrumental in the foundation of Edinburgh Lunatic Asylum, the building of which was begun in 1809 (In 1922 it became the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Mental and Nervous Disorders, and today is known simply as the Royal Edinburgh Hospital). In 1819, Andrew Duncan junior (1773-1832) was appointed to assist him in his Professorship, and in 1821 he became the first Physician to the King (or Queen) in Scotland. That same year he became President of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society. During his career, Duncan began publication of the quarterly Medical and philosophical commentaries (1773-1795) which went on to become Annals of medicine, and he also published Elements of therapeutics (1770), The new dispensatory (1786), and Observations on the distinguishing symptoms of three different species of pulmonary consumption (1813). Professor Andrew Duncan died on 5 July 1828."}

{"The Royal High School (RHS) of Edinburgh, today sited at East Barnton Avenue, in western Edinburgh, is a co-educational state school. It was founded in 1128 as the seminary of Holyrood Abbey and is one of the oldest schools in Scotland. By 1378, it was known as the Grammar School of the Church of Edinburgh, and it grew into a church-run burgh institution providing a Latin education for the sons of landed and burgess families, many of whom pursued careers in the church. In 1505 the school became the first in Britain to be designated a high school. In 1566, following the Reformation, Mary, Queen of Scots, transferred the school from the control of Holyrood Abbey to Edinburgh Town Council, and from about 1590 James VI accorded it royal patronage as the Schola Regia Edimburgensis. In 1584 the Town Council informed the rector, Hercules Rollock, that his aim should be 'to instruct the youth in pietie, guid maneris, doctrine and letteris'. As far as possible, instruction was carried out in Latin. The study of Greek began in 1614, and geography in 1742. The egalitarian spirit of Scotland and the classical tradition exerted a profound influence on the school culture and the Scottish Enlightenment. By the 19th century, the RHS had earned an international reputation and an influx of foreign students. The Royal High School was used as a model for the first public high school in the United States, the English High School of Boston, in 1821 Greek ceased to be compulsory in 1836, and in 1839 mathematics became recognised. The curriculum was gradually broadened to include French (1834), after-hours fencing and gymnastics (1843), German (1845), science (1848), drawing (1853), military drill (1865), English (1866), gymnastics as a formal subject and swimming (1885), music (1908), and history (1909). By 1866 classical masters were confined to teaching Latin and Greek. A modern and commercial course was introduced in 1873. A school choir was instituted in 1895. When William Duncan was a student in 1830-31, the RHS had just moved to the famous Regent Road building on Calton Hill (1829–1968)."}

The letter provides details of where copyright copies of the 'little book' are to be sent and on how the British National Bibliography organises itself.

{"Alan Anderson was born in 1922. He studied printing at Edinburgh College of Art in the early-1950s when he also founded the Tragara Press. Although the first book with a Tragara Press imprint appeared in 1954, Anderson worked mainly as a bookseller until the 1970s before devoting himself to printing and publishing full-time. He moved to Loanhead, Midlothian, in 1986, and then latterly to Beauly, Inverness-shire. The name, Tragara Press, is derived from the Punta Tragara hotel on the island of Capri, Italy, which had been a favourite destination for Anderson. Donald Weeks the Corvo scholar and biographer was a prolific contributor to the bibliography of the Tragara Press. Weeks was born on 18 April 1921, in Detroit, Michigan. As a child he had a talent for art and design, and he specialised in industrial design at Cass Technical High School, Detroit, before winning a scholarship to Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. After service with US Military Intelligence in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War, he returned to Detroit. There he worked as a freelance graphic designer, and became art editor of the Chevrolet in-house magazine. Week's had developed an interest in European literature and he became fascinated with the works of author Frederick William Rolfe (Baron Corvo) (1860-1913). Research into Rolfe led Donald Weeks to England in 1960, and then he moved there in 1966. He spent much of the rest of the 1960s following in Rolfe's footsteps, and began writing a biography. Weeks' work on Corvo (published by Tragara) would go much deeper than that of A. J. A. Symons in his Quest for Corvo (1952). Donald Weeks died in Middlesex Hospital on 7 September 2003."}

He converted to Catholicism in 1886 and he had a strong desire to become a priest though this was not fulfilled. He did however attend, for a while, the Scots College in Rome and during this time entered the circle of Caroline Shirley, Duchess Sforza Cesarini (1818-1897). He claimed that she had adopted him as a grandson giving him the title, Baron Corvo. Baron Corvo would become Rolfe's best-known pseudonym, though others were Frank English, Frederick Austin, and A. Crab Maid among others. He spent most of his life as a freelance writer, mainly in England but eventually in Venice, relying on benefactors for support. His principal work of fiction was Hadrian the Seventh (1904). Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo, died on 25 October 1913 and is buried on the Isola di San Michele, Venice."}

{"Alan Anderson was born in 1922. He studied printing at Edinburgh College of Art in the early-1950s when he also founded the Tragara Press. Although the first book with a Tragara Press imprint appeared in 1954, Anderson worked mainly as a bookseller until the 1970s before devoting himself to printing and publishing full-time. He moved to Loanhead, Midlothian, in 1986, and then latterly to Beauly, Inverness-shire. The name, Tragara Press, is derived from the Punta Tragara hotel on the island of Capri, Italy, which had been a favourite destination for Anderson. Donald Weeks the Corvo scholar and biographer was a prolific contributor to the bibliography of the Tragara Press. Weeks was born on 18 April 1921, in Detroit, Michigan. As a child he had a talent for art and design, and he specialised in industrial design at Cass Technical High School, Detroit, before winning a scholarship to Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. After service with US Military Intelligence in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War, he returned to Detroit. There he worked as a freelance graphic designer, and became art editor of the Chevrolet in-house magazine. Week's had developed an interest in European literature and he became fascinated with the works of author Frederick William Rolfe (Baron Corvo) (1860-1913). Research into Rolfe led Donald Weeks to England in 1960, and then he moved there in 1966. He spent much of the rest of the 1960s following in Rolfe's footsteps, and began writing a biography. Weeks' work on Corvo (published by Tragara) would go much deeper than that of A. J. A. Symons in his Quest for Corvo (1952). Donald Weeks died in Middlesex Hospital on 7 September 2003."}

{"Adam Ferguson FRSE, also known as Ferguson of Raith, was born 20 June 1723. He was a Scottish philosopher and historian of the Scottish Enlightenment. He died on 22 February 1816. The Poker Club - one of several at the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment - was formed in Edinburgh in 1762 with Professor Adam Ferguson taking a leading part. Its object was a patriotic one. Scots had been indignant at the neglect of Scottish interests by the government in London and were irate at the Militia Act which excluded Scotland from the power of raising a military force - after the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. Ferguson himself is said to have suggested the name 'Poker Club' when he was standing by the fire with a poker in hand. The Poker Club was to stir up an inert country and 'to poke' the fire of patriotic zeal in demand for restoration of the country's rights."}

{"John Gray was born in Bethnal Green, London on 2 March 1866. On leaving school he began work as a metal-worker but continued his education at evening classes, studying French, German, Latin, music and art. In 1882 he passed the Civil Service exams and, five years later, the University of London matriculation exams, after which he joined the Foreign Office as a librarian. Gray is better known as a playwright and poet, and he is regarded as the original 'Dorian' portrayed by Oscar Wilde. He had become one of the Oscar Wilde 'Set' and had signed one of his letters to Wilde with the name 'Dorian'. In addition to his friendship with Wilde, he had a close friendship with Eric Gill (1882-1940) and Marc-Andre-Raffalovich (1864-1934). In spite of the successful publication of his well-acclaimed poetry, and his Foreign Office career, Gray changed the direction of his life and entered the Scots College in Rome intending to become a priest. He was ordained in 1901 and then served as a priest in Edinburgh, at St. Peter's, Morningside. St. Peter's itself had been an idea conceived by Gray (initially a Curate at St. Patrick's Church, Edinburgh) and Andre Raffalovitch. In spite of his new career, his literary skills were not supressed and he published a novel in the 1920s and later on put together a volume of poetry - Poems (1931). His other work includes: poems, Silverpoints (1893); poems, Ad Matrem: Fourteen Scenes in the Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary (1903); and, poems, The Long Road (1926). The Rev. John Gray died on 14 June 1934."}

This comes after Lyell and Buckland made their discoveries in Scotland in 1824, but whilst he was also maintaining a law practice, funded by his father. Lyell was greatly involved with the Geological Society, serving as Secretary with George Poulett Scrope in 1825, and presenting papers on Tertiary exposures of the Hampshire coast in 1826. During the course of this notebook, Lyell began writing the first drafts of Principles of Geology. The first manuscript was delivered to the publisher at the close of 1827.During this period, Lyell's eyes, weakened from a time spent in Tuscany as a youth, grew stronger, and allowed him to plan trips further afield to Europe. Most biographies point to this period of time when he resolved to dedicate his time to his geology work. While working as a barrister on the western circuit, Lyell reads the evolutionary theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) and realizes that the mutability of species would affect geology as much as the biological sciences. Lyell nonetheless concludes that the fossil record is too imperfect to support the theory of evolution, and that the physical world is a stable balanced system.", 'Slip of paper referred to in Coll-203 Gen. 109 Lyell 1/527, giving detailed botanical editorial instructions concerning kelp and the growth of coal period trees, vegetation patterns and the resultant fossils.', "Letter to Sir Charles Lyell from Carlo Gemmellaro regarding his volcanic research on Mount Etna.

Discusses the geology of Aci Reale, in particular the strata of lava on which the village rests; Baron Waltershausen thought there were only 2 layers, Gemmellaro believes he has proven that there are 7 layers and has drawn a diagram to illustrate. He then describes, with diagram, the lava flow near Aci Reale which entered the sea at S.M. La Scala.

They visited geological locations around the capital Christiania (now Oslo), with the professor of geology at the University of Christiania Baltazar M. Keilhau as guide. Many of Lyell\'s theories about metamorphic and plutonic rocks were confirmed from his observations, and these confirmations were included in Elements of Geology , published the following year, in 1838. This was nearing the end of his two year presidency of the Geological Society, and during a tempestuous time for the science, when theories about evolution of the species were particularly divisive. In correspondence with Whewell in March of 1837 about the possibilities of the origination of new species, Lyell wrote why he left this topic to inference in Principles of Geology; ""If I had stated... the possibility of the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural, in contradistinction to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host of prejudices against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every step to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these mysterious subjects."

This series contains correspondence he continued with geologists, naturalists and other figures including John Pye Smith non-conformist divine, Sir Henry James director-general of the Ordnance Survey, Searles Valentine Wood and Anton Wilhelm Florentin von Zuccalmaglio.', "Charles Lyell lectured at King's College London in 1832 and again in 1833. He gave a single course at the Royal Institution in 1833.", "Sir Charles Lyell spent some time travelling in North America and published Travels in North America, ( 1845) . He amassed a collection of cuttings from various American newspapers which touched on various aspects of American life at the time including the Mexican War, politics (such as slavery, protectionism and taxation) and American universities (such as Harvard). Extracts from Lyell's aforementioned work, which was serialised, also feature.", 'In 1822 Charles Lyell began a geological survey of the County of Forfarshire for Dr John McCulloch who was preparing a geological map of Scotland. He combined the study with a long trip to his parental estate where he also entertained Professor William Hooker. Lyell returned in 1824 to complete 2/3 of the survey, with the companionship firstly of a Captain Ogilvy and later the Rev William Buckland. The studies led to his first published paper On a Recent Formation of Freshwater Limestone in Forfarshire, ( 1826) which he read at the Geological Society of London in 1824 and was later published in their transactions.', 'This series documents the fascination with which scientists of the early to mid 18th century regarded sea serpents. Numerous sightings were recorded, some of which are documented by these letters and cuttings.', 'This series contains the information gathered by Sir Charles Lyell on a visit to Madeira and the Canary Islands in the winter of 1853 and spring of 1854. He studied the volcanic and geological features of the island including fossils and shells.', 'The correspondence of Sir Charles Lyell includes letters from colleagues and acquaintances from around the world.', 'This series contains printed papers which relate to the work of Sir Charles Lyell as a geologist.', 'Notebook No. 129 was kept by Lyell during his trip to America in 1845-6, after his lecture tour, and contains his observations while he visited several plantations worked by enslaved people extracted from undocumented regions of Africa, and bought at auction. Mr. and Mrs. Lyell stayed with James Hamilton Couper at Hopeton plantation for two weeks in January 1846. Couper was a member of the British Royal Geological Society, and Lyell was President at the time. Hopetoun plantation was established by John Couper and James Hamilton, who had immigrated to Savannah, Georgia from Scotland as teenagers. John Couper\'s son, James Hamilton Couper took over as estate manager, and engaged in the trafficking of 637 people from Africa in 1806 to prepare the fields of their plantation, growing sea island cotton, sugar, and rice. Two important features of the plantation were the plantation canal, for irrigation and transportation, which Lyell took particular interest in, and a portable railroad. In 1833, the plantation was lauded as being the "finest example of crop diversification and efficient slave management" by a prominent southern publisher. When Lyell visited, there was likely 500 enslaved African people working 1,000 planted acres. Hopeton was a destination for many from Europe to witness slave labour, and reportedly "went away very much impressed with the humanity and skill with which James Hamilton Couper managed his slaves." In 1846, Sir Charles Lyell described Couper as "a benevolent slaveowner" and gained at Hopetoun "an hereditary regard and attachment between master and slave."', 'The earthquake which occured in the Wairarapa region of New Zealand in 1855 was the biggest earthquake New Zealand has ever suffered. 5000 km2 was shifted vertically, the maximum horizontal shift was 12 metres and the maximum uplift was 6 metres. These notes enabled Lyell to include an account of the earthquake in the 10th edition of Principles of geology, or, The modern changes of the earth and its inhabitants considered as illustrative of geology, ( 1867-1868) .', "Lyell's first visit to Sicily was in 1828 when he journeyed to Mount Etna to gather evidence for his theory that geological change was gradual and took place over millions of years. This ran counter to the Upheaval theory which was current at the time. This theory held that geological change was the result of a number of catastrophic events. He revisited Sicily in 1857 and 1858 to gather further evidence against the Upheaval Theory. He proved beyond doubt that the geology of Mount Etna was built up by a series of small eruptions rather than by one or two huge events. He was greatly aided in his research in Sicily by members of the Gemmellaro family, Carlo, Guiseppe and Gaetano Giorgio who were local geologists."}

{'Christmas cards from James Geikie in 1874 were kept, possibly by his wife.', 'James Geikie was the author of a number of books articles in scholarly journals.', 'Presscuttings of obituaries notices were accumulated following the death of James Geikie in 1915.', 'James Geikie received a number of testimonials from distinguished scientists when he was applying for the chair of geology at the University of Edinburgh. He also published numerous scholarly articles in journals of organisations such as the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, covering such topics as glaciation, geological research, and specific aspects of the geology of specific locations within Scotland, Britain, Europe and the wider world. His son, John Somerville Geikie also published on the subject of gold at Sarawak.', "'Aunt Phemie' (possibly Euphemia Somerville Johnston) made a number of decorative cards with butterfly adornments.", 'Various portrait photographs were taken of James Geikie. Alongside these were kept those of his wife, family and other photographs.', "Certain items of Geikie family correspondence were photocopied and microfilmed as were a number of letters by Charles Darwin. The former consisted mainly of letters from John Somerville Geikie and William [Geikie] from Sarawak and Singapore and include geological observations (John Somerville Geikie later pubished A List of Sarawak Minerals). The latter partly concermed James Geikie's publication, The Great Ice Age.", 'James Geikie gave lectures on a number of subjects at the University of Edinburgh, including geology, mineralogy and palaeontololgy. He was also involved in organising the syllabus and field trips and in setting examinations.', 'James Geikie kept and used a large number of maps in the course of his work. As a member of the Geological Survey for Scotland he was involved in geological mapping and he also mapped geological features in other parts of Britain, in Europe and further afield.', 'Much correspondence was conducted between different members of the Geikie family, such as James Geikie, his wife Mary (nee Johnston) and children Mary Dorothea, John (Jack) Somerville, James Stewart and George Ramsay. Professional correspondents with James Geikie included Robert Boog Watson.', "James Geikie (1839-1915) was the leading British authority on Pleistocene geology. He developed the theory, through observations in Scotland and Continental Europe, that during ice-ages mild inter-glacial periods interrupted the glacial period as a whole. He originated the current belief that human habitation continued in Europe throughout the glacial period. Geikie undertook classes at the University of Edinburgh while working in a printer's office. In 1861 he took up a position, with the Geological Survey, mapping glacial drift deposits in Central Scotland. This was supervised by his brother Archibald Geikie (1835-1924). Geikie made his reputation with the book The Great Ice Age and its Relation to the Antiquity of Man, ( 1874) , the 3rd edition of which was fully revised in 1894. In 1882 he succeeded his brother, Sir Archibald Geikie as the second Murchison Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh. While undertaking his duties two seminal textbooks were published: Outlines of Geology, ( 1886) and Structural and Field Geology, ( 1905) . In 1889 Geikie was awarded the Murchison medal by the Geological Society, London and the Brisbane Medal by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was a founder member of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and the President from 1904-1910. For a period he also edited the magazine. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1875 and was President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh when he died.", 'In the course of his professional life, James Geikie exchanged correspondence with a number of geologists and other scientists at home and abroad.'}

The slides, which range in date from the 1870s to the 1930s, cover a wide range of subjects; photographs of indigenous peoples from around the world, international travel scenes, personal portraits (frequently of figures connected with the natural/veterinary/agricultural sciences), images and portraits of domestic animals (chiefly sheep, poultry, cows and pigs), illustrations and extracts from books, articles and newspapers. The majority of the slides are black and white, although some are hand-coloured or tinted. Many of the slides were produced by T.J. Walls, an optician on Forrest Road, Edinburgh. It is thought that at least a proportion of the collection was created or collected by James Cossar Ewart as well as Robert Wallace, in their capacities as professors of, respectively, Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Edinburgh, and were probably used for teaching and illustrative purposes. Both Ewart and Wallace appear (separately) in the slides, as do colleagues and other persons known to both or either of the men.

{"Edinburgh University Tea Club first met in the Upper Library Hall, Old College, Edinburgh University on 5 November 1920. It emerged at a time when the University was gradually opening itself up to female students. Although a Women's Union had been formed on similar lines to the student Union already existing for men, it was felt that women who were associated with the teaching staff of the University, either directly or through their husbands, would enjoy having a similar opportunity to meet socially. By 1945, the Club had flourishing tennis and badminton sections, an annual golf outing and a club for folk-dancing. There were also children's Christmas parties. In 1966, a flat within Edinburgh University property at Buccleuch Place was made available to the Club where newcomers could become introduced to members and which could act as a focal point for the Club."}

{'Edinburgh Indian Association was formed in 1883 and comprised 6 members. Its main function was to serve the social and cultural needs of Indian students attending the University of Edinburgh. By the beginning of the 20th century there were over 200 members. Premises at 11 George Square were leased following a fundraising drive in in 1907. These contained a debating hall, dining hall, library and billiard room. The redevelopment of George Square in the 1960s saw the end of No. 11. This combined with a marked reduction in Indian students saw a decline in the Association but it found a new role in the 1970s as an organisation for Indians who had settled here. By its centenary in 1983, it was also promoting ethnic arts in Scotland.'}

{'William Dick was the son of an Aberdeenshire farrier who had established himself in Edinburgh in the latter part of the eighteenth century. He availed himself of the unparalleled opportunities for education then available in Edinburgh, attending lectures given by John Barclay, a well known and respected anatomist. Dr. Barclay encouraged this intelligent young man, who travelled to London in 1817 to study at the London Veterinary College. Such was Dick\'s previous education in Edinburgh that, within three months, he "had the confidence to apply for a diploma" - and got it. Back in Edinburgh, he then faced the frustrating task of establishing his own veterinary school. He repeatedly presented free lectures to small groups of students. Finally, in November 1823 a regular class got underway, supported throughout the entire session by student fees totalling £42 and a grant of £50 from the Highland Society, of which Dr. Barclay was a Director. The School was to make more or less steady progress, with its finances and the manners and morals of the students watched over by William\'s redoubtable elder sister Mary! These students were expected to attend classes given by medical lecturers in the University. A system of oral examinations was established and by 1828 there was a final public examination. Successful students received a certificate stating that they were "qualified to practise the veterinary art". In 1833, Dick paid for the erection of improved accommodation on the site of his forge in Clyde Street. This was to serve his school until 1914, when it moved into new buildings at Summerhall that are still in use. In 1839, his school officially became a College and he a Professor. By the time of Dick\'s death in 1866, the 818 students he had taught were to be found throughout the world. Among them were the founders of veterinary schools in Canada, USA, Australia and Ireland. The College continued to flourish and its staff have played a major part in the life of the profession and of the Royal College. Among the most famous of its graduates was John McFadyean, who entered the College at its low point in 1874 and later became a member of its staff. He then went as Principal to the London Veterinary School and has been justifiably claimed as the founder of modern veterinary science. Perhaps his most outstanding moment was his courageous, but so polite, public rebuttal, at a conference in Edinburgh in 1901, of Robert Koch\'s vehemently held conviction that bovine tuberculosis was little hazard to man. Other particularly notable graduates include Thomas Dalling, Alexander Robertson and Robert Coombs. The college was reconstituted as an integral part of the University of Edinburgh in 1951 and became a full faculty in 1964.'}

{"In December 1988, Lothian Regional Council (LRC) and Lothian Health Board (LHB) announced the formation of a new body, the Waverley Care Trust. Responsibility for the organisation of Trust meetings rested with the Regional Secretary's Department and trustees included the Lord Provost of the City of Edinburgh, the Chairman of Lothian Health Board and the Bishop of Edinburgh. Waverley Care Trust, working with the Milestone Venture Trust, was responsible for the establishment of a residential care facility for people with HIV and AIDS called Milestone House, which opened in 1991 in the grounds of the City Hospital. In 1993, the SOLAS Information and Resource Centre, which had previously been run as an independent organisation, became a sister project of Milestone House, offering a community space for those affected by HIV to obtain information and support. In the following years, the Waverley Care Arts Project was jointly administered by SOLAS and Milestone, with art-based activities being delivered in both locations. Another key function was added in 1996, with the establishment of the Buddy Service, which offered the opportunity for those affected by HIV and AIDS to receive one-on-one support from trained volunteers. In July 2003, the organisation was incorporated as a Company limited by guarantee under the name Waverley Care. Waverley Care's organisational remit expanded to include all blood-borne viruses, formally acknowledging the increased work Waverley Care was doing with those diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Geographically, the charity also broadened its scope in the 2000s: 2005 saw the African Health Project being delivered in Glasgow from a new office in the city, while in 2007, the first national project was launched in the form of an outreach and support initiative for children across Scotland affected by HIV. The work of Waverley Care was extended to Lanarkshire, Fife and the Borders in 2009, and then to the Highland area and Argyll and Bute the following year, with a new office being opened in Inverness.", 'Following the closure of premises then operating as the Gateway Exchange, an arts and social centre for former prisoners, drug addicts and alcoholics, the buildings at 2/4 Abbeymount were offered to Lothian Regional Council in 1988 as a potential HIV and AIDS information and resource centre. The council commissioned a three-month feasibility study assessing the need for such a centre, which concluded that there was both demand and wide-ranging local support for the idea. Taking its name from the Gaelic word for light, the SOLAS HIV and AIDS Resource Centre was constituted in February 1989 and formally registered as a charity in May of that year. The appointment of a Development Worker and an Administrative Worker in November 1989 facilitated the implementation of the project and, after significant renovation, the building officially opened in November 1991. SOLAS became a sister project of Milestone House under the banner of Waverley Care Trust on 1 Nov 1993. Key services offered at the centre included a café, a play facility, an information centre, a range of complementary therapies, and bookable rooms for support groups, meetings and social events.', 'Milestone House officially opened in January 1991, and the first resident was admitted on 18 February 1991. Situated in the grounds of the City Hospital, Edinburgh, though administered independently of the NHS, Milestone House was established to offer convalescence, terminal care and respite care for people with HIV or AIDS. At the point of opening, Milestone House comprised four bungalows, each with three single rooms, one double room and one guest room, as well as a shared central social space. By 1999, the services offered at Milestone House had adapted to reflect the positive effects of new drug treatments and combination therapy, with an increased focus on respite care rather than palliative and terminal care.'}

{"The London County Council had its own Press Bureau at County Hall on London's South Bank, which produced and distributed Press Releases announcing significant events or decisions. Percy Johnson-Marshall collected press releases which related to the work of the Architect's Department - architecture, housing or city planning. Further public relations for the Architect's Department were achieved through publication of articles concerning their work in professional journals and newspapers. Percy Johnson-Marshall kept a file of these, and may have been the author of some of them.", "During his membership of the Association of Building Professionals (ABT), Percy Johnson-Marshall was a member of a number of committees. He was chair of the Architects' Professional Advisory Committee and secretary of the Planning Committee from 1948-1950. In addition he participated in the work of the Technical Committee, the Education Committee and the Student Liaison Committee. Percy Johnson-Marshall also attended meetings of the Executive Committee and the General Council and retained some of the papers for future reference.", 'In the early 1970s, local authorities moved towards city development plans that were compiled from local plans of specific areas. Conservation, as well as redevelopment, was by this time high on the agenda. The South Side locality of Edinburgh, designated by the local authority in 1972, contained much of the land involved in the University Comprehensive Development Area (CDA). This CDA scheme was stagnant by 1970 and officially extinct in 1975. Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates were commissioned by the City of Edinburgh to prepare the South Side Local Plan, reporting on housing quality, residency and population, commercial uses and buildings of architectural interest (1973-1975). Johnson-Marshall was also required to report to the University Development Committee on the progress of the South Side Local Plan and its implications for the University of Edinburgh.', "London County Council Architect's Department acquired a large quantity of photographs of London pre World War II and post blitz, as well as generating images of its own exhibitions, models and developments, both in construction and complete. Many of these were intended for its own publications, exhibitions and for press distribution.", "The University of Edinburgh Mound / Lawnmarket Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) involved a large block of historic structures in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, including New College, Mylne's Court, James Court, the Outlook Tower, Lister House, and Semple's Court. New College and some residential properties, all badly in need of restoration, were transferred from the Church of Scotland to the University in 1961. Ian G Lindsay & Partners were then engaged as architects for the restoration of New College and to produce a feasibility study for the conversion of Mylne's Court for student accommodation. In 1964 the University launched a Comprehensive Development Area project with the intention of creating a complex of student residences by purchasing and rehabilitating all the properties in the area. Percy Johnson-Marshall was made planning consultant with John Reid, of Ian Lindsay & Partners, as specialist conservation architects and Hall & Sons as consulting engineers. Mylne's Court was successfully converted in two phases, Philip Henman Hall and Edward Salveson Hall (1966-1970). Other conversion projects within the CDA - James Court, the Outlook Tower and Semple's Close - were abandoned for economic reasons and the properties disposed of. With the exception of Lister House, which was reconstructed and re-opened as Patrick Geddes Hall in 1978, named after Sir Patrick Geddes who worked from the Outlook Tower during the 1890s. A scheme by architect John Reid, of Ian G Lindsay & Partners for an entirely new student hostel, together with a lecture room extension for New College was abandoned, in 1970, in favour of full restoration of New College.", 'While posted with the British Army in India, during World War II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) from 1943 until his repatriation in 1945. One of his duties was the administration of the organisation. He kept a number of files concerning this, some in a numbered series and the remainder unnumbered. The files described in this series are those which have been recovered.', 'Additional sites of importance to the University of Edinburgh included its playing fields at Peffermill, to the south-east of the city. A site dedicated to student residences at Salisbury Green, just to the east of the central area, was developed from 1955 as the Pollock Halls of Residence and named in honour of the donor of the land, Sir John Donald Pollock. The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies became part of the University in 1951 and there was development of its sites at Summerhall (1969-1971), just south of the central area and at the Bush Estate (1952), to the north-west of the city.', 'After leaving Liverpool School of Architecture at the University of Liverpool, Percy Johnson-Marshall, along with fellow former student Robert H Shaw, were instrumental in setting up the Liverpool School of Architecture Society as a club for former students. He established the club collected names and addresses and organised an inaugural dinner on the 25 March 1938 which over 50 attended. At this dinner a committee was formed to administer the club, with Professor Lionel Bailey Budden as President, Robert Joseph Gardner-Medwin amongst the Executive Committee and Percy Johnson-Marshall as the Honorary Secretary . The club does not appear to have had a long-life, with the last mentioned activity in this collection being a film and supper evening on the 27 October 1938.', 'Percy Johnson-Marshall was Honorary Secretary of the Coventry Branch of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA), while working for Donald Gibson\'s team at Coventry City Architectural and Planning Department. The Branch mounted a week long exhibition entitled "Coventry of tomorrow: towards a beautiful city" from 6-13 May 1940. This was the culmination of a publicity campaign aiming to generate local enthusiasm for new plans of the city which had been created by Gibson\'s team. The ideas presented at the exhibition pre-dated the World War II bombing, which started on 14 November 1940, which led to the requirement for comprehensive redevelopment plans for the city. The AASTA became became the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) in 1942.', 'While studying for both the Diploma in Architecture and the Certificate in Civic Design at the University of Liverpool, Percy Johnson-Marshall entered architectural designs for a number of prize competitions, in addition to his course work. On two occasions he entered as a partnership, once with his brother Stirrat Johnson-Marshall and once with a colleague JH Parker. He was successful in winning the HW Williams Prize for the Promotion of Architectural Design in Concrete also in 1936 for his design of a "Bus station for Liverpool".', 'During World War II, Coventry civic centre was destroyed by bomb damage. The raid on 14 November 1940 made it necessary to completely rebuild the area. City Architect Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson took the opportunity to further develop his planning ideas which he had already displayed in the "Coventry of Tomorrow Exhibition" held between 6-13 May 1940. As a member of Gibson\'s team, between1938-1941, Percy Johnson-Marshall took an active part in the planning process. He collected photographs of the architectural models which he participated in creating and of the redevelopment plans these were derived from. He also collected press clippings with articles relating to the redevelopment. After leaving Coventry City Council for active service in India and Burma Johnson-Marshall retained his interest in the project and continued to collect press clippings, plans and related papers. He later used these as the basis for a chapter in his book Rebuilding Cities ( 1966)', "Sir Robert Hogg Matthew first proposed the University of Edinburgh/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) in 1960. This would bring together the University of Edinburgh, the Corporation of the City of Edinburgh and private enterprise to create one coherent redevelopment plan. Percy Johnson-Marshall was appointed Planning Consultant to the University of Edinburgh in 1962 following a viability survey and interim report the previous year. His scheme proposed a tripartite megastructure, with upper-level pedestrian circulation and traffic segregation. The Nicolson Street commercial area would be flanked by University structures to the west and an area, designated for redevelopment by the Corporation for housing purposes, to the east. The University development proceeded on the assumption that the CDA would achieve statutory status, with Johnson-Marshall supervising its design and negotiating with the City Planning Department of the Corporation of the City of Edinburgh and, for a time, a private developer, Ravenseft Properties Limited. The CDA was superseded by the South Side Local Plan ( 1975) , prepared for the Corporation by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates. Johnson-Marshall remained planning consultant to the University until 1985, with Bristo Square, designed by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates, and completed in 1982, the final element to the University's unfinished scheme.", 'London County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 3, the Bermondsey Reconstruction Area was created in 1949. It consisted of 117 acres of warehouses, docks and housing, which had suffered extensive bomb damage during World War II. Redevelopment by London County Council was mainly residential schemes, including the Canada housing estate, which mixed tall towers and four-storey maisonettes.', "In England the tiered system of political representation entails local authorities, which exercise a measure of devolved power from the national government of the United Kingdom. The regional, or city, council is an elected body of representatives controlling certain aspects of the administration of local government. The council, or corporation, employs a body of professional officials, essentially civil servants, both administrative and technical, to undertake its work. A variety of departments, such as Parks or Housing, with their own staff, are directed by committees of councillors, which are specific to the remit of each department. Larger departments often require sub-committees, although all the committees are technically sub-committees of the Full Council and its vote. The committees and sub- committees of London County Council generated a body of material including agendas for, and minutes of, their meetings. The committees were informed by a variety of reports from the London County Council's own officials, as well as from national governmental bodies and independent professional bodies.", "While employed by Willesden Borough Council, Percy Johnson-Marshall collected copies of architectural plans for some of the borough's public building projects. These are mostly attributed to the borough engineer F Wilkinson and his successor F Wayman Brown, and include school extensions, housing developments, an electricity showroom and a refuse plant. Percy Johnson-Marshall worked on a number of these projects, and his initials appear on a some of the plans.", 'The University of Edinburgh/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) was mapped out by Percy Johnson-Marshall, Planning Consultant, in 1961-1962. All University building work in the central area was subject to this overall plan. Building projects and proposed developments within the CDA included, Bristo Square, George Square, Chambers Street, the Student Amenity, The Medical School Extension, the Physical Education Building, Old College and Buccleuch Place. As part of their work, the planning consultants acquired any material thought to be relevant, including plans for proposed University buildings, plans and alteration schemes for existing University buildings and copies of development plans by any other party pertaining to the Comprehensive Development Area.', "The site at Salisbury Green in Edinburgh was donated to the University of Edinburgh by Sir Donald Pollock in 1943. From 1955 it has been in a more-or-less permanent state of development. From 1949-1976 the University's architect site consultant was Sir William Kininmonth, of Rowand Anderson & Kininmonth.", 'In the early 1950s registration and associateship of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) was obtained through completing an examination in professional practice. In July 1952 notice was given that new regulations would come into effect in November 1952 making practical experience an additional criteria. A number of students were subsequently told that the exams they had completed in March 1952 only made them eligible for registration, despite pre-dating the change in regulations, and appealed to the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) for arbitration.', "Coventry City Architect's Department, under the direction of Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson, undertook experimental public housing schemes during the early 1940s. These included the use of pre-fabricated housing and new construction techniques. As an employee of the department from 1938-1941, Percy Johnson-Marshall was involved in the design of these schemes. He collected photographs and plans of the Canley Estate along with press-clippings, journal articles and the commemorative programme produced for the Estate's official opening.", "Comprehensive Development Areas, a statutory designation under the Town and Country Planning Act (1947) , permitted the local authority to tackle the issue of urban blight, preventing piecemeal uncoordinated development, and directing future development according to a coherent plan. In order to achieve Comprehensive development Area designation, local authority town planners were required to provide evidence for consideration by the relevant government ministry, initially the Ministry of Reconstruction, then, after 1946, the Ministry of Town and Country Planning and the Ministry of Housing, which would then make a Declaratory Order. Eight Comprehensive Development Areas were included in the Administrative County of London Development Plan (1951) : City of London; Stepney/Poplar; Bermondsey; South Bank; Elephant and Castle; Bunhill Fields; Lewisham Clock Tower; Woolwich, St Mary's. The scheme was broken down into the individual development areas for detailed implementation. An overview was also required, and files and plans relating to the whole Comprehensive Development Areas Project were also created.", "Percy Johnson-Marshall collected copies of Keystone - the Journal of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants. This was renamed Keystone - the Journal of the Association of Building Technicians when the Association's name changed in 1942. He did not keep full runs of the Journal and only a number of copies are held in the collection.", 'London County Council Architect\'s Department organised many local exhibitions explaining to the public exactly the implications of reconstruction or comprehensive development for their neighbourhoods, with models, plans and photographs. The 1951 Festival of Britain resulted in a large temporary exhibition on London\'s South Bank and a "Live Architecture" exhibition, at Lansbury, London, which was part of the Stepney / Poplar Comprehensive Development Area in the East End. This demonstrated a completely planned neighbourhood, with houses, shops, schools and a market.', 'Some of the work undertaken by Percy Johnson-Marshall, while he was a student at the University of Liverpool, was undated. This means it is impossible to identify which course or year group the work belonged to. The source of the projects below could not be identified.', "Percy Edwin Alan Johnson-Marshall (1915-1993) was one of the most energetic of a generation of town-planners who began their careers in the 1930s and, after the Second World War, dedicated their lives to the creation of a new world of social equity through the radical transformation of the human environment. Born in Ajmer, India, he was brought by his parents, via the Middle East, to England in the 1920s. In 1931 Percy followed his brother Stirrat Johnson-Marshall to the School of Architecture at the University of Liverpool. Here he studied under the two most eminent professors of the period, Sir Charles Herbert Reilly and Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie. After gaining the Diploma in Architecture (with distinction), in 1936, Johnson-Marshall entered public service as assistant architect, first for Middlesex County Council, then for Willesden Borough Council (1936-1938). In the meantime he had taken a postgraduate certificate in Civic Design, at the University of Liverpool Department of Civic Design. In 1938 Coventry City Council created its new City Architect's Department, appointing the highly respected Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson, later Sir Donald, as Chief Architect. Johnson-Marshall was hired by Gibson and given the post of Senior Assistant Architect in charge of redesigning the obsolete city-centre, in 1939. The design of the new civic centre was given added impetus when Coventry was devastated in a bombing raid in November 1940. Johnson-Marshall was called-up for military service in 1941 and, after basic training in England, saw service with the Royal Engineers in India and Burma. During his time in the army, he lost his first wife in Coventry and met and married his second wife in India. He was also actively involved in the Service's Architect's Technical Organisation (SATO), leading teaching groups, giving lectures and writing articles on planning. Having achieved the rank of Major, he was attached to the Government of Burma as an advisor on reconstruction and, with William Tatton-Brown, devised a reconstruction plan for the country (1946). After demobilisation, Johnson-Marshall worked as Assistant Regional Planning Officer for the newly created Ministry of Town &mp; Country Planning (1946-1948). During this time he took the intensive completion course, at the School of Planning and Research for Regional Development (SPRRD), in order to gain his Diploma in Town Planning. In 1949 Johnson-Marshall was appointed Senior Planner, in charge of Comprehensive Development Areas to the Architect's Department of the London County Council. He was also a part-time teacher at the SPRRD and, from 1948, Secretary of the School of Planning Club. From 1956 to 1959 he was Group Planning Officer for North-East London before taking up a post as Lecturer in Planning at the newly-created Department of Architecture, at the University of Edinburgh. There he set up the Planning Research Unit, in 1962, which undertook a number of regional surveys for the Scottish Development Department. In 1964, he became Professor of his own Department of Urban Design and Regional Planning. He retired from this post in 1985, becoming the director of the Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies, until his illness in 1987-1988. After Johnson-Marshall was appointed Planning Consultant to the University of Edinburgh, a firm of planning consultants, Percy Johnson-Marshall &mp; Associates, was set up, in 1960. During Johnson-Marshall's lifetime, a number of major commissions were carried out, including regional and sub-regional plans, conservation areas, comprehensive redevelopment areas and residential development plans. During his career, Johnson-Marshall was a member of a number of institutes and involved in numerous other activities. He was elected member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1938 and served as a member of council and of the Education Committee. In 1947 he was elected member of the Royal Town Planning Institute, also serving as a member of council and of the Education Committee. He was a founding member of the International Centre for Regional Planning and Development (ICRPD), in 1954. He was also a member of: the Executive Committee of the Housing Centre Trust, the Society for the Promotion of Urban Renewal (SPUR), and the MARS Group of the Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. He sat on the World Health Organisation's expert panel on Environmental Health and Planning (1970) and was consultant on Human Settlements for the United Nation's Conference on the Human Environment (1972), Chairman of the Royal Town Planning Institute's Town and Country Planning Summer Schools, and, from 1977-1980, Vice President of the International Society of City and Regional Planners (ISoCARP). In 1975, Professor Johnson-Marshall was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), in recognition of his contribution to the planning profession.", "Bunhill Fields suffered 73% bomb damage during World War II and was designated as London County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 6. It is in London's St Luke's area and adjoins the City of London's Barbican area. It had a mixture of commercial, industrial and residential uses. It was divided into three sections: the western part was to be developed by the the Corporation of London, and included the Northampton College of Technology extension, by the London County Council Architect's Department Schools Division and the Golden Lane Housing Scheme in the Borough of Finsbury. The central part, between Golden Lane and Whitecross Street, was sponsored by the Peabody Trust. The eastern part, where many pre-war flats survived, was partially redeveloped for housing.", "The University of Edinburgh's King's Buildings site, to the south of the city, was acquired in 1919 and since then has steadily been developed with buildings for the Faculties of Science and Engineering and some non-University institutes. Percy Johnson-Marshall was appointed site consultant in 1964, coordinating developments, allocating sites for buildings and determining the roads and general layout in a series of reports and feasibility studies. In this, he was responsible to the King's Buildings Committee, itself a sub-committee of the University Development Committee, and the various sub-committees involved with specific buildings, until 1985. During Johnson-Marshall's tenure, buildings by a variety of architects were erected for: Biology, Forestry & Natural Resources (the Darwin Building); Maths, Physics & Computer Science (the James Clerk-Maxwell Building); Botany; the (new) Refectory and Boiler House; Experimental Petrology, and Epigenetics. Many existing buildings were also extended and Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates were the architects for the system-build multi-storey car park.", "The Reconstruction Areas Group (RAG) was part of the Town Planning Division within the London County Council Architect's Department. This was set up in 1949 to deal with bomb-damaged areas using powers created under the Town and Country Planning Act (1944) . The designation of such areas allowed London County Council to purchase property to facilitate reconstruction, subject to the approval of the Minister for Reconstruction. In 1956 the Town Planning Division was reorganised into three divisions, North-West, North-East and South. Percy Johnson-Marshall was put in charge of the North-East division, which included Stepney/Poplar and Bunhill Fields, replacing the RAG. The Housing Division, consisting of architects and technicians, was responsible for the design and construction of a substantial number of the dwellings that were built by the Housing Department of London County Council. It also had some input into the design and layout of London County Council housing contracts undertaken by private architects. Development in London was carried out according to the principles contained in the County of London Development Plan. Such statutory development plans are subjected to constant review based on the progress of the current plan. The Town Planning Division of the LCC Architect's Department was required to provide statements on policy and progress to facilitate revision of the County of London Development Plan. The 1943 plan was revised in 1951 and 1955. Public Inquiries played a role in the planning process, taking place prior to national government decisions on the approval of development plan reviews, the designation of Comprehensive Development Areas and Reconstruction Areas, as well as in the event of appeals by developers against decisions made by the local planning authority. In London the Architect's Department was required to provide proofs of evidence for consideration by the reporters to the public inquiries. Open Space Deficiency was one of the problems identified in the County Of London Plan (1943, 1951 and 1955) and the Town Planning Division of London County Council Architect's Department attempted to address this issue by allocating open spaces at agreed standards, on a neighbourhood basis, in its development schemes. In London residential areas this was 4 acres per 1000 persons.", "Under the Town and Country Planning Act (1947) Comprehensive Development Areas (CDAs), proposed by a local authority and approved by the Secretary of State, allowed land and property to be acquired, for broad planning purposes, using compulsory purchase orders, if necessary. The Administrative County of London Development Plan, (1951) , identified 100 areas in need of comprehensive development but it was only feasible to designate eight CDAs: City of London, Stepney / Poplar, Bermondsey, South Bank, Elephant and Castle, Bunhill Fields, Lewisham Clock Tower and Woolwich. The Reconstruction Areas Group (RAG), with Percy Johnson-Marshall as senior planner, was set up within the Planning Division of the London County Council's Architects Department to administer the CDAs, in 1949. Work continued in some CDAs after the Planning Division was reorganised in 1956, with Percy Johnson-Marshall overseeing those which fell within the jurisdiction of the North East Group.", 'Percy Johnson-Marshall remained at the University of Liverpool to study for the Certificate in Civic Design, after completing his Diploma in Architecture at the Liverpool School of Architecture. Some of the assignments undertaken for the certificate have survived, including his final thesis project for a proposed town planning scheme for the town of March.', "Sociological reports provided essential material and data for planning any neighbourhood. These would include information about the community, their housing, occupations and places of work, membership of churches and clubs etc. London County Council Architect's Department had its own sociologist, Margaret Willis and often also consulted Dr Ruth Glass and John Westergaard of the Association for Planning and Regional Reconstruction. Willis produced a number of reports including: Play Areas (1951) , Living in High Flats (1951) , Maisonettes (1952) .", 'The Association of Building Technicians was founded in 1919 as the Architects\' and Surveyors\' Assistants\' Professional Union. In 1924 it became the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA). It changed name again in 1942 to become the Association of Building Technicians (ABT). During his early working life Percy Johnson-Marshall was an active member of the Association. He held office on a number of central and regional committees. Work on these included overseeing the authorship of reports and representing students in professional disputes. He was also one of the organisers of the "Coventry of Tomorrow Exhibition" mounted by the Coventry Branch of the AASTA in 1940. During the course of his membership, Johnson-Marshall also collected a selection of published material produced by the association.', "Woolwich, the most easterly of London's Boroughs south of the River Thames, had an area of 63 acres of land bombed during World War II, and obsolescent property in and around the docks at St Mary's.

Work on the first phase, for pathology, commenced in 1956, to a design amended by Sir Basil Urwin Spence. The second phase, pharmacology, was built during 1968-1970. There was considerable delay before work commenced on the third phase in 1976. This was to house biochemistry and the medical library, with John Hardie Glover designing the library within Ramsay's building. The third phase, was completed in 1978, and named, the Hugh Robson Building after the former University Vice-chancellor who died in 1977, and Erskine Medical Library. Plans for further phases were shelved and the former George Watson's Ladies' College, which occupied the remainder of north George Square, was instead converted for the use of the Department of Psychology by Spence, Glover & Ferguson (1977-1978).", "Percy Johnson-Marshall and Associates was founded, in 1962, by Percy Johnson-Marshall as a Planning Consultancy, initially on the strength of his appointment as Planning Consultant to the University of Edinburgh for its Comprehensive Development Areas. The company was originally based in outbuildings at Johnson-Marshall's house, Bella Vista, Duddingston, Edinburgh. The company specialised in Urban Design and Regional Plans, with very few architectural designs before 1980. Regional plans were produced for Porto, Portugal (1973-1975) and, in association with Sir Robert Hogg Matthew for Coleraine, Northern Ireland (1966-1968), and Islamabad (1961). Major redevelopment plans were also produced for Kilmarnock, Sunderland, Newcastle upon Tyne (1968-1971) and Salford (1961-1967). Between 1980 and his retirement in 1985, Johnson-Marshall's input declined, as the company moved towards more conventional architectural work and urban improvements. During this time work began to appear under the name of Johnson-Marshall, Mackie and Hare, and later Percy Johnson-Marshall & Partners (PJMP), with Bruce Hare as principal architect.", "Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a number of resources and administrative files relating to his staff management role, while in charge of the Reconstruction Areas Group, and later the North East Group of the Town Planning Division of London County Council's Architect's Department. Resources comprised internal telephone directories. Administrative files include staffing issues, and the reorganisation of the Division in 1956.", 'While posted with the army in India, during World War II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) from 1943 until his repatriation in 1945. He received reports from, and corresponded with, the regional groups across India and Burma, including modern day Bangladesh and Pakistan. This correspondence was filed according to group and numbered sequentially. The files described in this series are those which have been recovered from the set.', "The various committees and sub-committees of the Association of Building Technicians wrote responses to major reports by other bodies, and reports recommending best practice for the professions which the union represented. As Chairman of the Architects' Professional Advisory Committee (1946-1947) and Secretary to the Planning Committee (1948-1950), Percy Johnson-Marshall was involved in coordinating research and compilation of these reports. A number of manuscript and typewritten drafts have been retained, along with some background research information and accompanying correspondence.", 'Planning consultant to the University of Edinburgh, Percy Johnson-Marshall was frequently asked to produce reports for specific projects, or sites, within the University Comprehensive Development Area (CDA), such as the High School Yards Site (1971) and the Empire Garage site (1977) Feasibility studies were also commissioned by the University from other architects, such as the Buccleuch Church site for which Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall & Partners produced unexecuted schemes in 1971 and 1973. Studies and reports carried out on behalf of other organisations for sites within the CDA were essential material for planning the CDA.', 'The main building of the University of Edinburgh is Old College built during the 18th and 19th centuries to designs by Robert Adam and William Henry Playfair. Since then there have been successive works to repair, alter and convert its accommodation and upgrade the quadrangle. In the late 1940s, R Gordon Brown produced an unexecuted scheme, as did Ian G Lindsay & partners, in the mid-1960s. Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates produced reports on its rehabilitation in 1976-1977.', 'South East South London borough of Lewisham, adjoining Bermondsey, was a highly mixed area with the River Thames in the north, dense urban fabric in the centre and leafy suburbs to the south. As a result of its town centre being devastated by a flying bomb in 1944, a 40 acre Comprehensive Development Area was designated by London County Council at Lewisham Clock Tower.', "Chambers Street, Edinburgh, is dominated by the University of Edinburgh's 18th century Old College building and the Royal Scottish Museum, on its south side. The street was included in the University of Edinburgh/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area on its northern boundary. Chambers Street, together with the adjacent George IV Bridge, featured in several feasibility studies in the 1970s as the government sought to extend both the Museum and the National Library of Scotland (NLS). The Ministry of Public Buildings and Works produced an unexecuted scheme to extend the Museum in 1970, with another drafted by the Department of the Environment, in 1973. A competition-winning design for the Museum extension, by Benson & Forsyth, was finally completed in 2000. The removal of Heriot-Watt University to a new campus left its old Chambers Street building vacant. It was first considered for use by the University of Edinburgh and then by the NLS, with a feasibility study produced by the Department of the Environment and Plowman, Craven & Associates (1973) before it was ultimately taken over by the Crown Office as its headquarters. The NLS extension was finally built behind the existing building (1999-2001). Since 1926 the University has occupied Minto House, which is flanked by the Heriot-Watt building and an entrance to the Argyll Brewery site. The University of Edinburgh acquired the brewery in 1972 and Ian G Lindsay & Partners undertook feasibility studies. In 1975, the Departments of Architecture, Urban Design & Regional Planning and Landscape Architecture moved into premises comprising Minto House and the brewery maltings, which had been converted for the purpose by Ian G Lindsay & Partners. Another part of the brewery site, in the Cowgate, was redeveloped for student accommodation in the 1990s, and the ancient Tailor's Hall sold to a private developer.", 'The University of Edinburgh has operated from a variety of sites for many years and all of these have been subject to development of varying scale throughout the 20th century, all under the authority of the University Court. While these sites were developed as individual architectural entities, they were all part of the development of an ever-expanding University and were complementary to each other. For example, academic development that would allow an increase in students was directly related to the development of halls of residence and student amenities. Statistics were vital in coordinating the great expansion of the mid-20th century. Displacement and decanting of university personnel during development was a complex matter that relied upon accurate information derived from site use surveys. The financial costs and forecasts had to be viewed in a University-wide context, as well as a site-specific one. Development accounts had to be carefully balanced, as most capital expenditure was funded by the Government through the University Grants Committee. In order to keep the public and University staff informed about development proposals, Percy Johnson-Marshall organised a standing exhibition, "An Expanding University" at Adam House, Chambers Street, which lasted from 1963-1973. For students and staff, understanding of, and movement between, University sites, was explained by a continuing series of published maps.', "Percy Johnson-Marshall retained an interest in the continued redevelopment of Coventry long after he ceased to be a member of the City Architect's Department's staff in 1941. At some point he acquired a number of internal reports from the renamed Coventry City Architectural and Planning Department, where Arthur Ling was now the City Architect and Planning Officer. He also collected a number of plans relating to the redevelopment of Coventry, produced by the same department, which both pre-dated and post-dated his period of employment there between 1938-1941. This material was probably collected as background research for his book Rebuilding Cities ( 1966)", "The City of Edinburgh's elected representative body, from 1900-1975 was the City of Edinburgh Corporation. This was succeeded in 1975 by Edinburgh District Council. In Scotland, decisions are, for the most part, delegated to specialist committees, which perform as sub-committees to the Full Council. This enables detailed consideration of complicated matters, which the Full Council would not have time to examine closely. Committee decisions have to be ratified by the Full Council. In addition working parties, consisting of non-elected experts and Council officials are frequently set up to report to the Council with advice on important but complicated issues. One such working party, the City of Edinburgh Working Party on Major Highway Planning (1963-1983), gathered information and formulated proposals concerning the city's, seemingly intractable roads problems. The governing body of the University of Edinburgh is the University Court. Sub-committees of the Court are created to take responsibility for investigating and making recommendations to the Court on time-consuming issues. The Development Committee, constituted in 1954, as successor to the Post-war Development Committee, had responsibility for the physical development of the University. The Works and Buildings Committee was constituted in 1965, as a successor to the Major Buildings Committee, and had responsibility for individual building projects, dealing directly with the architects and user-group sub-committees.", 'Prior to bombing during World War II, the adjacent boroughs of Stepney and Poplar, in London\'s East End, had suffered from urban blight in the forms of overcrowding, obsolescent buildings and lack of open space. 2000 acres were designated as a Comprehensive Development Area no 2 by London County Council. This was replanned as a series of eleven neighbourhoods in 1948-1949. Residential density was set at 136 persons per acre, for a planned population of 100,000 in total. Each neighbourhood had its own community, educational and shopping facilities. Industry was zoned along the canal and by the docks, a new road pattern established and large new public open spaces laid out. Neighbourhoods included Lansbury, which featured in the "Live Architecture" Exhibition, as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951, and the completely new neighbourhood of St Anne\'s, at Limehouse.', 'Despite protests to the War Office by Coventry City Architect, Donald Gibson, Percy Johnson-Marshall was drafted, for active service in World War II, in 1941. After basic training in England, during which time he gave lectures on planning to comrades, he was assigned to the Royal Engineers and posted to India, in 1942, with a commission as Captain, later promoted to Major. In India, Johnson-Marshall became General Secretary of the Service Architects\' Organisation (SAO), later renamed the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO), and was extremely active promoting the cause of city and regional planning and reconstruction. This was done through a series of lectures to servicemen and Indian organisations, such as the Indian Institute of Engineers (Bengal) as well as articles for journals, such as the Journal of the Indian Institute of Architects, and radio broadcasts for All-India Radio, in Calcutta. In addition, as a response to the lack of training for effective reconstruction, he prepared a memorandum for the Viceroy\'s Executive Council, Proposed faculties of planning, design and technics for India (1944). Most of his Indian output was included in a private press booklet Introduction to Planning (1944). Following the cessation of hostilities, Johnson-Marshall and William Tatton-Brown were seconded to the Government of Burma as advisors on planning and reconstruction. They submitted in three reports as A National Plan for Burma (1946). This was also outlined in an All-India Radio broadcast "The Burma Scene" (1946) and an article in the Architects\' Journal (May 1946).', "After completing his Diploma in Architecture at the University of Liverpool, Percy Johnson-Marshall was employed as Assistant Architect by Willesden Borough Council from 1936-1938, where his brother Stirrat was already employed. He worked on municipal architectural projects as part of the team under the borough engineers F Wilkinson and his successor F Wayman Brown. These included school alterations, public housing estates, a refuse disposal plant and the electricity showroom on Willesden Lane. Johnson-Marshall also worked on the design for the Willesden Cemetery superintendent's house, and it is possible that he was the main architect for this.", "Percy Johnson-Marshall was employed in Coventry City Architect's Department, as a member of Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson's team, from 1938-1941. During this time he collected papers, photographs, press-clippings and plans relating to the work being undertaken on the civic centre. Initially these were plans for comprehensive redevelopment. Following the civic centre's destruction in a World War II bombing raid, on 14 November 1940, plans for reconstruction were developed. Johnson-Marshall also collected material relating to the innovative public housing projects which were undertaken during his period of employment with Coventry City Council. One document survives concerning Johnson-Marshall employment record. This is a letter from Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson asking Lord Reith to release him from active service in India and Burma, as Gibson felt his skills would be better utilised in the reconstruction work being undertaken in Coventry.", "From 1962, Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates were consulted on alterations, improvements and extensions to the University of Edinburgh's playing fields at Peffermill, to the south of the city.", "244 acres in the City of London were considered suitable for Comprehensive Development, at Tower Hill, the Barbican and St Paul's Cathedral, and were designated as Comprehensive Development Area no 1 by London County Council. The Barbican was under the jurisdiction of the Corporation of London. They commissioned Charles Henry Holden and Sir William Graham Holford in 1947 as planning consultants for a reconstruction plan intended for private development. A joint London County Council/ Corporation of London basic scheme, involving pedestrian/traffic segregation was produced in 1949 and revised in 1954. A proposed development by the New Barbican Committee, an architects' consortium, was put forward in 1954, with Kadleigh, Horsburgh & Whitfield, as architects. This was rejected after a planning appeal. The Corporation of London commissioned its Golden Lane housing development from Chamberlin, Powell & Bon (although the site was actually in Finsbury). The St Paul's precinct was proposed in the Holford and Holden City of London Plan,1947, but re-planned by Holford, in consultation with the Ministry of Housing and the chairmen of London County Council and the Corporation of London. This design included a forecourt to the Cathedral and a commercial area with a decking system. The Tower of London Comprehensive Development Area was an area of urban blight with much war damage. The scheme attempted to create a suitable setting for the historic Tower. Partly in the City and partly in Stepney, this was a collaboration between the Corporation of London and the London County Council Planning Division North-East Group, under Percy Johnson-Marshall. The London County Council team leader was Walter Bor.", "With the exception of the Pollock Halls of Residence, Percy Johnson-Marshall was the planning consultant for all the University of Edinburgh sites. These included: George Square, Bristo Street and Potterrow, Old College, the High School Yards, King's Buildings, Old College and Peffer Mill Playing Fields.", 'The Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) was a voluntary organisation, which started life in Calcutta in 1943, during World War II, as the Service Architect\'s Organization (SAO). This group of British allied service men and women with architectural and planning backgrounds held technical meetings and produced a syllabus for a School of Indian Architecture and Regional Planning, in conjunction with Sris Chandra Chatterjee who had been campaigning for the formation of a school for twenty years. This was adopted as a faculty by the University of Calcutta. The group then went on to form the Service Arts Club, a forum for general arts discussion and education for servicemen and women in India. This met at Bengal Government School of Art. Groups formed in other Indian and Burmese cities under the umbrella of the Service Architect\'s Organization. These groups also had civilian members and held exhibitions, lectures, discussion groups, gave educational advice and undertook small architectural projects. They proposed a full education programme, part of which was supervising distance learning candidates in SE Asia for the London School of Planning and Research for Regional Development course in Town and Country Planning. Plans to develop cultural and educational centres at military bases were presented along with the new name - Service Arts and Technical Organization - in January 1945. By this time the organisation was spread throughout SE Asia, with over twenty regional groups which established their own sections and societies in accordance with the artistic interests of their members. The following were the published aims; 1. to build up a service organization of all those technically concerned with planning, building and engineering reconstruction, and to represent their views 2. to develop and assist cultural and scientific planning activities 3. to form clubs and groups and educational and cultural centres for the purpose of holding exhibitions, discussions, lectures etc, to keep libraries and to organise service "Technical Colleges" 4. to assist in the education of students 5. to assist services welfare and education and to give talks to Reconstruction and Planning Units to educate the public concerning possibilities and the use of experts 6. to keep members in touch with current events, especially professional matters concerning technical personnel for reconstruction By September 1945, under the leadership of the General Secretary, Percy Johnson-Marshall, the organisation moved away from general arts endeavours and cited its first priority as an information provider concerning "resettlement and reconstruction". With this in mind "propaganda" concerning this was made available, along with the establishment of a programme of technical education for troops. Attempts to give the organisation official educational status within the British Army were supported by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) and the Association for Planning and Regional Reconstruction (APRR) who formed a Joint Committee and unsuccessfully approached the War Office. Regardless, Percy Johnson-Marshall set-up an experimental "tech" of 80 students, and coordinated education for the group. This included efforts to ensure that troops had access to distance learning courses whose exams were ratified by relevant professional bodies in Britain. SATO also addressed technical education for Indian and Burmese nationals and this was exemplified by the opening of the SATO Polytechnic in Rangoon on 12 November 1945. Having finally been given official sanction the polytechnic operated both in-college and distance learning courses and provided access to text books, public lectures and touring exhibitions. Percy Johnson-Marshall ceased being the general secretary in November 1945. He was repatriated in May 1946. Shortly afterwards SATO ceased to exist with the gradual repatriation of the organisation\'s active members.', 'London County Council was the principal local government body for Greater London, an elected assembly with responsibility for the 28 metropolitan boroughs from 1887-1965. Borough services included street cleaning, lighting, libraries and rates collection, while the County was responsible for education, ambulances, fire brigades and sewage. Both County and Boroughs were responsible for public housing. The Boroughs could not grant planning consent and although the City of London had its own Corporation, London County Council was the relevant planning authority from 1947.', "Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, a street of Georgian Tenements, lies immediately to the south of George Square and therefore became part of the University of Edinburgh's various redevelopment schemes. Property was acquired there in the 1950s and 1960s in anticipation of demolition - Percy Johnson-Marshall's Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) scheme envisaged the Arts Faculty buildings extending into Buccleuch Place during later phases of development. One block was demolished in 1959-1960 to make way for the first phase of the Arts Faculty Buildings. Other properties were converted into temporary University accommodation or were used to house tenants displaced by other developments in the area. With the abandonment of the CDA plan (1975) and the statutory listing of the surviving buildings, Buccleuch Street remains largely in University use.", "The International Centre for Regional Planning and Development (ICRPD) was conceived at a joint symposium held in London in 1953, organised by the School of Planning and Research for Regional Development, the School of Planning Club and Community Development Projects Ltd. At the symposium it was agreed that a centre for research and education, which would provide an information service and a meeting place, was required to enable closer contacts between the professions concerned with regional planning and development. A preparatory Committee was elected, which went on to organise the International Conference on Regional Planning and Development held at Bedford College, London in 1955. At this conference the resolution was passed to investigate setting up such a centre. GE Janson-Smith from the United Kingdom was elected chair of the international Provisional Committee charged with the investigation. Percy Johnson-Marshall was elected one of the British members. This Committee, through a number of meetings, developed a constitution for the proposed centre, which was finally approved in November 1957. An International Seminar, which studied the history and concepts of regional planning, was held in The Hague, by the Netherlands Universities Foundation for International Cooperation, on behalf of the ICRPD in July 1958. At this conference practical goals and membership criteria of the ICRPD were established, the focus having moved from the establishment of a physical centre to a dispersed programme of professional support and international collaboration. The ICRPD would aim to: document and diffuse information, undertake research, hold meetings, educate, create a register of experts and consultants and undertake public relations. In 1958 the ICRPD exhibited at the World Exhibition in Brussels. International relations began to sour when it became apparent that a lack of financial support from the United Kingdom government, amongst accusations of communist sympathies, meant that the centre of activities would likely be established in the Netherlands. At this stage the British Group of the ICRPD, chaired by Robert Joseph Gardner-Medwin became more active. It had its own General Council, on which Percy Johnson-Marshall sat, and arranged study days for its members. These included the titles 'Economic forces leading to urban concentration' and 'Urbanisation in the tropics - its causes and methods of control'. Plans for an ICRPD Conference in Rhodes in April 1963 were strongly contested by the British Group, leading to the resignation of the president Leo Brandt.", 'Percy Johnson-Marshall was employed by Coventry City Council in the Coventry City Architect\'s Department between 1938-1941. During his employment the City Architect was Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson. Gibson was an innovative architect and town planner who embraced a project planning comprehensive redevelopment of the civic centre. These plans became reality after the destruction of the city\'s historic centre during a World War II bombing raid on 14 November 1940 left the city centre destroyed. Gibson was also interested in social housing and undertook some of the earliest use of prefabricated housing and other innovative construction techniques. Johnson-Marshall was an enthusiastic and valued member of Gibson\'s team. He participated in the construction of the first model for the redevelopment of the Civic Centre during his spare time. He was also one of the organisers of the "Coventry of Tomorrow Exhibition" mounted by the Coventry Branch of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA) in 1940, which show cased Gibson\'s ideas. When Johnson-Marshall was called up for active service in World War II Gibson made appeals for him to be repatriated to rejoin his team. Johnson-Marshall\'s period of employment with Coventry City Council had a profound effect on his later career, introducing him to the reality of planning for reconstruction and comprehensive redevelopment. He later used materials he collected both during and after his employment as the basis of a chapter of his book addressing these topics, Rebuilding Cities ( 1966) .', "The University of Edinburgh's post-World War II development was centered on George Square, originally a Georgian residential square with a large central garden. Development had already commenced on the Medical School Extension (1956) and the Faculty of Arts phase one, according to the Sir Basil Urwin Spence layout of 1955, when Percy Johnson-Marshall was appointed Planning Consultant. Johnson-Marshall was not the architect of any of the George Square buildings but took responsibility for the overall layout, designation of sites, harmonisation of finishes, landscaping and external works. The second phase of the Arts Faculty Buildings (1967), the Main Library (1967), two further phases of the Medical School extension (1970 and 1978) and the first phase of the First-Year Science buildings (1966) were completed during Johnson-Marshall's tenure.", 'While posted with the British Army in India, during World War II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) from 1943 until his repatriation in 1945. One of his duties was liaison with other appropriate bodies such as the Association of Building Technicians and the School of Planning and Research for Regional Development. He also liaised with army personnel posted in other world regions who were either affiliated or considering setting up affiliation organisations to SATO', "As an undergraduate, Percy Johnson-Marshall studied for the Diploma in Architecture at the Liverpool School of Architecture, at the University of Liverpool, from 1931-1936. A large number of Percy Johnson-Marshall's complete assignments, from every year of his Diploma studies, have been carefully preserved", 'Percy Johnson-Marshall studied at the Liverpool School of Architecture at the University of Liverpool, where his brother Stirrat Johnson-Marshall was already a student, from 1931-1938. He initially completed a Diploma in Architecture and afterwards the Certificate in Civic Design. While a student Johnson-Marshall studied under a number of brilliant professorships. When he started his studies, the professor of architecture was Sir Charles Herbert Reilly who was followed by Lionel Bailey Budden in 1933. Meanwhile Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie was the professor of civic design until 1935 and it is likely that Johnson-Marshall studied under him. Johnson-Marshall was a very able student, and during his time in Liverpool he won a number of awards, including the John Lewis Partnership Prize, 1936 and the HW Williams Prize for the Promotion of Architectural Design in Concrete, also in 1936. His education at the University of Liverpool had a lasting influence over both his style and future career. After leaving the University, Percy Johnson-Marshall, along with other former students, instigated the formation of the Liverpool School of Architecture Society, a club for former students. After a successful inauguration dinner, this appears to have had a short life.', "Parking facilities at the University of Edinburgh's various sites were centrally controlled and frequently reviewed by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates.", 'The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London was set up in 1957 "to examine the present system and working of local government in the Greater London area", reporting in 1960 with recommendations that led to the abolition of London County Council and the setting up of the Greater London Council in 1965. During the inquiry, information and evidence was collected from all the departments of London County Council and the 28 Metropolitan Boroughs, with specialist evidence sought from professional bodies in all the relevant fields of expertise. London County Council\'s Architect\'s Department provided evidence on its own organisation and working practices, while the Royal Town Planning Institute gave evidence on the effectiveness of the Architect\'s Department, as well as on the operation of all the Council committees involved in the overall planning process.', "The principles and guidelines for city development were contained in various manuals and handbooks. London County Council Architect's Department produced a number of manuals of its own, pertaining to planning, building controls, traffic congestion and internal protocols. Meanwhile the Ministry of Town and Country Planning produced important guidelines, such as its Handbook, The Redevelopment of Central Areas (1947) , which outlined the correct sequence of survey and development and the rules of development, in terms of daylighting control and plot ratio. Circulars were produced by Her Majesty's Stationary Office relating to both the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 and Town and Country Planning Act, 1959, which were circulated around the London County Council's Architect's Department.", "Bristo Square was conceived in Percy Johnson-Marshall's 1962 Comprehensive Development Area plan as a new civic square enclosed by Student Amenity buildings and the University of Edinburgh's Victorian graduation hall. This new square was to replace the old Bristo Street and its plan depended upon the re-alignment of Potterrow and Lothian Street by Lothian Regional Council. In 1979, a design by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates, with Jamieson, MacKay & Partners as consulting engineers was approved. Following the re-alignment of the road, work on the square was completed in 1982.", 'While employed by Willesden Borough Council Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a few photographs of buildings, which the council designed, both during and after construction.', "A site for the University of Edinburgh Student Amenity Centre was allocated between Marshall Street and Lothian Street, in 1943. Layouts were proposed in the Charles Henry Holden Scheme (1947) and the Sir Basil Urwin Spence Scheme (1955). Percy Johnson-Marshall's plan (1962-1982) arranged the student buildings to the north and east of his planned new Bristo Square. Morris & Steedman were appointed architects for the Amenity Centre in 1962, with work commencing in 1967. The first phase (Refectory and Health Centre) was completed in 1969 and the second (including Bank, Shops and Chaplaincy Centre) in 1976. Two further phases were cancelled.", "In the course of his role as planning consultant to the University of Edinburgh, Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a range of associated printed material, to enable him to understand the wider context within which he worked. Some of these related to the wider planning issues in Edinburgh, and the City Council's reports concerning these. He also collected press-clippings and journal articles concerning the University of Edinburgh Comprehensive Development Area and information concerning the history and development of the areas surrounding the University.", 'In 1965, when the University of Edinburgh Development Committee was reconstituted, the Major Buildings Committee and the former Works Committee were dissolved and the new Works and Buildings Committee came into being. This Committee had control of all buildings, whether planned or existing, and liaised directly with the architects and user-group sub-committees, while a Minor Buildings Sub-Committee dealt with works under £5,000. Percy Johnson-Marshall reported to this committee in terms of his overall master plans, matters of general layout and coordination of external works etc.', "London County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 4: South Bank comprises: the area of the Thames riverbank between Vauxhall and Southwark Bridges in 5 sectors: Albert Embankment; St Thomas's Hospital Precinct; the Permanent Development Area, including County Hall; the area between Waterloo and Blackfriars Bridges; and the area between Blackfriars and Southwark Bridges (Bankside). The Permanent Development Area, designed in 1949 included the temporary exhibition site that was used during the Festival of Britain (1951) The first of the permanent buildings was the Royal Festival Hall, by the London County Council Architect's Department (1951). The scheme was further amended in 1953 and 1957, during which time there were negotiations concerning proposed developments by Shell, Decca Records and the British European Airways. Later, Sir Robert Hogg Matthew was consultant architect for a proposed development by Acquila Investments, in 1960. The National Film Theatre, designed by Denys Lasdun, was opened in 1967.", "Percy Johnson-Marshall took up his first university teaching position as Senior Lecturer in Planning at the University of Edinburgh's new Department of Architecture, in 1959. He taught Civic Design to architecture undergraduates and a postgraduate diploma course in Civic Design. In 1963 he began a course in Regional Planning and, the following year, became Professor of Urban Design and Regional Planning. Later he headed his own Department of Urban Design and Regional Planning, within Sir Robert Hogg Matthew's School of the Built Environment (1966-1967). Post-doctorial fellowships and postgraduate research were available within the Planning Research Unit (PRU), which Johnson-Marshall set up in 1959. The PRU, was independently funded and undertook research for a variety of governmental organisations including the Scottish Development Department. The Architecture Research Unit (ARU), formerly the Housing Research Unit, was set up by Sir Robert Hogg Matthew in 1959 and undertook research and design projects for various local authorities. There was also the opportunity for postgraduate research under its auspices. Johnson-Marshall deputised for Matthew as director of the ARU while the latter was engaged with duties for the Royal Institute for British Architects and International Union of Architects. In 1985, the Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies was opened under the directorship of Percy Johnson-Marshall. This was in the Outlook Tower, the symbolic headquarters of Sir Patrick Geddes, which the University of Edinburgh had acquired. He retired from the post in 1991.", 'London County Council accepted the axioms of the County of London Plan (1943) by John Henry Forshaw and Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie, in 1945. Thereafter they produced the Administrative County of London Development Plan (1951) . Effectively this was the statutory plan required by the Town and Country Planning Act (1947) . This provided the framework for city development, and its recommendations constituted the assumptions underlying planning decisions. The Plan was subjected to reviews, and in this respect proposals were collected and advanced for consideration. The Minister of Town and Country Planning approved the revised Plan in 1955, with the next review following in 1960.', "The planned Edinburgh Eastern Link Road threatened the University of Edinburgh's Physical Education building at the Pleasance and a site for a replacement was allocated between Marshall Street and Crichton Street. By 1973, this site was being considered for a number of uses and another site for the Physical Education building was allocated on the east side of Potterrow, on the site of the old the Empire Garage (1977). With the cancellation of the Link Road plans, in 1977, this project was abandoned.", "The London County Council Town Planning Committee was a sub-committee of the full Council, which convened to consider planning applications under the regulations of the Town & Country Planning Act (1947) . In arriving at its decisions, the Committee sought the recommendations of the Town Planning Division of the Architect's Department which in turn gathered opinions from Council officials in its various departments, such as Parks and Roads, as well as from non-Council bodies and statutory undertakers such as the Thames Ports Authority, the Metropolitan Police Service and London Transport. A number of planning sub-committees existed to consider specific aspects of development proposals, with specialist sub-committees to consider: (compliance with) the Development Plan; Areas of High Fire Risk, Redevelopment and Road Improvements, Architectural and Historic Buildings; London Bye Laws; Special Improvements and Developments. Developments, on behalf of London County Council, by its own Architect's Department, were also subject to this process. A decision by the Town Planning Committee was equivalent to a recommendation for approval, or rejection, by the Full Council. The Full Council often considered large or important developments, in the first instance.", 'While employed by Willesden Borough Council Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a few papers relating to contracts and specifications for municipal buildings. He also retained a pamphlet produced to honour the opening of "Electric House" built by Willesden Borough Council and designed by the borough architect F Wilkinson.', 'The University of Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh jointly ran the Edinburgh Dental Hospital and School. Its Chambers Street building (1927) was reconstructed by Rowand Anderson, Kininmonth & Paul in 1953. When the Corporation of the City of Edinburgh refused consent for a site for a new larger building in Lauriston Place, in 1965, Percy Johnson-Marshall was asked to prepare a feasibility study for the only site available, which was between Crichton Street and Marshall Street (1973). This had already been earmarked for Student Amenities, a Physical Education building and buildings for the Science Faculty (Appleton Tower extension). However the Empire Garage site, on Potterrow, was re-allocated for the Physical Education building and designs for the new Dental Hospital were produced by Morris & Steedman (1975-1977). The funding did not materialise and nothing was built, however.', "A Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) was a designation under the Town and Country Planning Act (1947) . This allowed a local authority to acquire property in the designated area, using powers of compulsory purchase in order to replan and develop urban areas suffering from war damage or urban blight. Surveys and feasibility studies were required for a CDA to be considered and approved by the relevant Government Minister. In Scotland, this was the Secretary of State for Scotland. The University of Edinburgh had two CDAs planned. Unusually these were instigated by the University, rather than the local authority, and planned by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates. The University/Nicolson Street CDA (1962) comprised a large area including that already earmarked for University development. The latter was to be linked to a new commercial zone and a residential area to the east and required collaboration between the University, the Local Authority and private developers. The scheme, however, stagnated and was never approved by the Secretary of State, becoming officially defunct in 1975, with Local Government Reorganisation and the publication of the South Side Local Plan, (formerly intended as the South Side District Plan). The Mound/Lawnmarket CDA was another proposal by Johnson-Marshall that never achieved statutory status. This area consisted of about 8 acres of densely built-up, and fairly ancient property in the Old Town surrounding the headquarters of the University's Faculty of Divinity at New College. The scheme started with the need for renovation of New College and the dire state of some historic buildings adjacent to it (1961). A CDA was proposed in 1967 to enable expansion of the academic buildings and conversion of several old tenements for student accommodation. However, the scheme was scaled down, although Mylne's Court was successfully rehabilitated for residencies and New College restored, by 1970. Ultimately, other properties were found to be not viable for conversion and the CDA proposal was advanced no further. The University operated from a variety of sites: the Central Area, including George Square and Old College; King's Buildings, the location of the Faculties of Science and Engineering; Pollock Halls, the student residences; The Mound/Lawnmarket, including New College; High School Yards, where many historic buildings were converted for University use, between 1905 and 1965. There were also departments operating from individual sites around the city.", 'While posted with the British Army in India, during World War II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) from 1943 until his repatriation in 1945. While he was in post SATO achieved its aim of setting up their own polytechnic to train army personnel in a variety of technical skills. These included aspects of the building trade, to ensure that returning British troops had the required skills to undertake employment in post-war reconstruction. The polytechnic also enrolled army personnel who held Indian or Burmese nationality to improve available skills for local reconstruction. This was run by the 12th Army and based in Burma. Percy Johnson-Marshall kept a number of files concerning the development and opening of the polytechnic as well as the course which it offered.', "The Architect's Department of London County Council was responsible for the development of London according to its own statutory plan. This entailed positive planning as well as controlling or vetting private development. The Department was under the leadership of the Architect to London County Council. Sir Robert Hogg Matthew was the first post-war Chief Architect (1946-1953), succeeded by Sir Leslie Martin (1953-1956) and then Hubert Bennet. It was the largest such local authority organisation in Western Europe, with 3000 staff in 1956. Its design staff undertook a variety of jobs for London County Council departments, such as Housing, Parks, Schools and general civic improvements. From 1946-1949 the Architect's Department was made up of four main divisions: The Housing Division, the Schools Division, the Planning Division and the General Division. The Housing Division was the largest and was itself served by a Housing Engineers Division, Structural Division and Quantities Division. The Schools Division was a smaller group, with much design work contracted out to private architects. It had responsibility for maintenance, however. The Planning Division was arranged into four sub-groups: Information and Research, the Development Plan Group, the Application Group and the Reconstruction Areas Group. Percy Johnson-Marshall was put in charge of the Reconstruction Areas Group when it was set up in 1949. At this time the Planning Division was under the directorship of Arthur Ling. In 1956 these groups were amalgamated into one single Policy Group for North East, North West and South London districts. Percy Johnson-Marshall was in charge of the North East group until 1959. The General Division dealt with anything that was not Schools, Planning or Housing.", "Although Percy Johnson-Marshall was most involved with the Town Planning Committee, there were a number of other London County Council Committees which he consulted the papers of. The Housing Committee formulated the housing policies of London County Council and directed the work of officials in its Housing Department. It had many sub-committees, including the Development and Management Sub-Committee, which dealt with providing new Council housing. This might be designed by the Architect's Department or by private sector architect's, with work carried out either by London County Council direct labour organisation or contracted out to construction firms. There were also London County Council committees for Parks, Roads and Education, which itself had sub-committees for Schools, School Planning, and Further Education.", "The first Statutory City Development Plan of 1949, and its successors, recommended major highway improvements for Edinburgh. Plans were discussed and redrawn over a long period. The Working Party on Major Highway Planning was set up to consider the alternatives and advise the local authority on transport strategy. The Eastern Link Road, from St Leonard's to Calton Hill, was of particular interest to the University of Edinburgh as it occupied property affected by the Link and its feeder roads. Resolution of the Eastern Link Road issue was critical for the finalisation of the layout of the University / Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area. Percy Johnson-Marshall represented the University's interests as expert planner on the Working Party. One of Johnson-Marshall's own proposals was for a new carriageway through the Grassmarket for which he commissioned perspectives from Alexander Duncan Bell, in 1963. The Eastern Link Road was abandoned in 1977.", "As well as the areas designated as Comprehensive Development Areas, London County Council Architect's Department had other development areas of importance. These were at the Quadrant Estate, Islington; the Loughborough Estate, Brixton; the Roehampton Estate; the Ackroyden Estate, Putney; the Brandon Estate, Southwark; the Priory at Blackheath and Bethnal Green.", "An area extensively bombed during World War II, the London County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 5: Elephant and Castle centered on a junction of the roads from Westminster and the Waterloo and Blackfriars Bridges. The basic redevelopment design went through various permutations before London County Council built the London College of Printing, designed by the Schools Division of the Architect's Department. In 1951 Percy Johnson-Marshall and Arthur Ling proposed a multi-level intersection and combining the two underground stations. A more modest scheme, with a single level roundabout (1954), was superceded by one involving limited competitions, drafted by Gordon Logie, in 1960. A competition for the design for the commercial development, to be undertaken by private developers, was won by Erno Goldfinger. Messrs Boissevain and Osmond won a second competition, for a shopping centre.", 'For the information of University of Edinburgh staff and the public, Percy Johnson-Marshall organised a standing exhibition of the University\'s many development schemes, entitled "An Expanding University", at the examination halls, Adam House. This included models, maps, plans, drawings and photographs. Alexander Duncan-Bell was responsible for constantly updating the arrangement and layout and the exhibition, which ran from 1963-1973.', 'In the course of his membership of the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) and its forerunner the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA), Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a variety of general information such as membership details, membership cards, pamphlets and information on the association\'s activities. He appears to have attended the 1957 conference "Housing the city dweller" and retained both organisational details and copies of the papers presented.', "The University of Edinburgh Development Committee (UDC) was a subcommittee of the University of Edinburgh Court, the governing body of the University. Convened by the Principal, with the University Secretary as secretary, it had responsibility for the physical development of the University. Its job was to translate academic aspirations into plans for buildings, appointing architects, negotiating with the local authority and arranging funding with the University Grants Committee. The UDC itself spawned numerous sub-committees, from time to time, such as the Science Faculty Development Sub-committee and the Conservation Group Sub-committee and other site-specific and building user-groups. As Planning Consultant to the University, Percy Johnson-Marshall received his instructions from the Committee. He provided plans, models, reports and recommendations in respect of his responsibility for the Central Area. This included Bristo Square, George Square, Chambers Street, the Student Amenity Centre, the Medical School Extension, the proposed Dental Hospital, the proposed Physical Education building, Old College and Buccleuch Place; all under the auspices of the University/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) scheme. He was also responsible for the Mound/Lawnmarket CDA; incorporating Mylne's Court, as well as the King's Buildings site and Peffer Mill playing fields."}

{"Scottish poet, writer, artist and gardener Ian Hamilton Finlay, CBE, was born in Nassau, Bahamas, on 28 October 1925. He was educated at Dollar Academy, in Clackmannanshire, Scotland. In 1942, he joined the army, fighting in the Second World War.After the war, Finlay worked as a shepherd, and then began to write short stories and poems, while living on Rousay, in Orkney. He published his first book, The Sea Bed and Other Stories (1958) and some of his plays were broadcast on the BBC. His stories often featured in the newspapers. A collection of poetry followed, The Dancers Inherit the Party (1960). It was as a 'concrete poet' though that Finlay gained renown after he published Rapel (1963) - 'concrete poetry' laying importance on the layout and typography of the words to give effect. He then began to compose poems for inscription into stone which were incorporated into sculptures for the natural environment. Out of this emerged the 5-acre garden at Little Sparta in the Pentlands near Edinburgh, created together with his wife Sue Finlay.Finlay received a Turner Prize nomination in 1985. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Aberdeen University in 1987, Heriot-Watt University in 1993 and the University of Glasgow in 2001, and an honorary and/or visiting professorship from the University of Dundee in 1999. He received the Scottish Horticultural Medal from the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society in 2002, and the Scottish Arts Council Creative Scotland Award in 2003.He had collaborated with Patrick Caulfield, Richard Demarco, Malcolm Fraser, and Christopher Hall. He also worked with a host of lettering artists including Michael Harvey and Nicholas Sloan. He also collaborated with Joanne Soroka who produced tapestries based on Finlay's 'concrete poetry'. These mainly consisted of one-word-per-line short poems.Ian Hamilton Finlay became a CBE in 2002, and he died on 27 March 2006.Award-winning artist Joanne Soroka was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1949. She attended McGill University, 1970, where she obtained the degree of BA, then went to Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, being awarded the Diploma in Design in 1972. At the Edinburgh College of Art she obtained a Post-graduate diploma (with distinction) in 1976.Soroka is currently a part-time lecturer, University of Edinburgh, from 2010. Previously she was a part-time tutor, Edinburgh College of Art, 1992-2010. She founded Ivory Tapestries in 1987, and has been Artistic Director at the Edinburgh Tapestry Company (Dovecot Studios), 1982-87."}

{"Charles Oppenheimer was born in Chorlton-upon-Medlock, Manchester, on 10 October 1875. His father was from a German Jewish family in Brunswick, and his mother was from Montrose, Scotland. Charles was a prize-winning student at Manchester School of Art, and his first picture was exhibited at the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts in 1894, though the title of the work is now lost. His studies also took him to Italy in 1868, and he returned there in 1898 and again 1912. Oppenheimer married Constance Emily Taylor in 1903, and in 1908 - after a chance meeting with Ernest Archibald Taylor (1874-1951), the Scottish designer and painter - the couple moved to Kirkcudbright in Scotland, first to a home rented from Edward Atkinson Hornel (1864-1933), another of his associates. In Kirkcudbright, the light suited Oppenheimer as it did the other artists working there. By this time Oppenheimer too had established himself, having exhibited his first picture at the Royal Academy in 1906, Old Mills, Montreuil, and having a line drawing published in the Manchester Guardian, 1906. He had also exhibited A Whitby View, a watercolour, and The end of the day, an oil, in Liverpool. During the First World War, he served with the Royal Garrison Artillery and his unit was the 180 Siege battery. He saw action around Bethune and Lens. He was also engaged with the 1 Corps Intelligence Section. A year after the Armistice, Oppenheimer donated his watercolour The Green Crassier, Lens to the Imperial War Museum. Other works over six decades include: The Lion of St. Mark, Venice, exhibited 1898, illuminated manuscript The Eve of St. Agnes (c. 1901), Kirkcudbright Harbour (c. 1910), Kirkcudbright (c. 1913), Verona (1914), Morning mist - Lake of Lugano (c. 1925), Siena at dusk (c. 1929), San Francesco, Assisi (1930s), and Blossom, Buckland Burn (c. 1940). Oppenheimer exhibited at the Royal Academy in London, the Royal Scottish Academy, at the Royal Scottish Academy of Painters in Watercolours (RSW), at the Royal Glasgow Institute of Fine Arts, the Aberdeen Artists' Society, and in Liverpool. He designed a number of posters for Britain's railways, depicting local beauty spots, and he also designed the badge and motto 'Sempere Vigilo' of the Scottish Police Force (now Police Scotland). Oppenheimer helped to found the Dumfries and Galloway Fine Art Society, and he was a special constable in Kirkcudbright and also served on Kirkcudbright Town Council. Charles Oppenheimer died in Kirkcudbright on 16 April 1961."}

Helen's husband, James Wilson - Sir John's son - was a captain with the Lanarkshire Yeomenry in Gallipoli and Egypt. For the war effort, various Home Front groups and organisations produced entertainments to raise funds for the Red Cross and other organisations. Rehearsals for entertainments by a theatrical group - 'The Eves' - were held at the Home of Helen Wilson at Colquhalzie in Perth. One of their performances took place at the local village hall at Muthill in aid of the National Work Party. Other performances were at Porteous Hall, Crieff, in aid of the Scottish Red Cross, and at the Pavilion Hall, Glasgow. Most of the cast of 'The Eves' were female and the name of their group was derived from the fact that their husbands, brothers, and fathers (the Adams) were serving in the forces. They offered sketches taken from London musical theatre productions, songs, recitations, choruses and dances. They were accompanied by piano or by the Auchterarder Ladies Orchestra."}

Other subjects are animals, with two of these showing a dog and cart and a donkey and cart. The captions on them read, 'Cartes de Visite are now la mode, I call with mine at your abode', and 'Cartes de Visite are quite a passion, And every Donkey is in the fashion'. A card featuring a woman in her confortable parlour, reads 'Cartes de Visite foa Lady who would be happy to do your mending'. A card showing a man dressing, reads 'Cartes de Visite of a Gentleman who wants his buttons attended to'.Such cards are scarce, they appear not to have been popular or collected at the time and even now collectors are said only to seek carte-de-visites if they are photographic.

{"James Hamilton was born in Edinburgh in 1767. He was one of two sons of Alexander Hamilton (1739-1802), Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University. James Hamilton was given medical training by his father and became his assistant at the age of twenty-one. He and his father founded Edinburgh's Lying-in Hospital in Park Place in 1793, and later on this enterprise would become supported partly from his own funds. In 1800, Hamilton succeeded his father as Professor of Midwifery at the University. Their subject however had been slow to be accepted by the Senatus Academicus as part of the medical curriculum and in 1815 Hamilton raised the matter of recognition for midwifery. He faced hostility however, particularly from Dr. James Gregory (1753-1821), and recognition would not be achieved until 1830. Although his classes were, for a long time, non-essential for graduation, they were well attended, and Hamilton's contribution to midwifery included advocacy of uterine suture after Caesarian operations and the introduction of the term 'eclampsia' for convulsions in labour or puerperium. Hamilton's publications included A collection of engravings designed to facilitate the study of midwifery (1796), Hints for the treatment of the principal diseases of infancy and childhood (1809), and Practical observations on various subjects relating to midwifery (1836-1837)."}

{"Writer and reviewer John Middleton Murry was born in Peckham, London, 6 August 1889. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and Brasenose College, Oxford. His literary career began in 1911 and his last book was published in 1957. Murry promoted the work of his wife, Katherine Mansfield, after her death in 1923, and his friendship with D. H. Lawrence inspired work on the great novelist. In the 1920s, Murry's interests shifted from literature to religious philosophy, and in the 1930s he converted to Marxism and then moved politically towards pacifism. His writing of the period reflected these shifts in interest. John Middleton Murry died 12 March 1957. That year too saw the publication of his Love, Freedom and Society about the thought of his friend D. H. Lawrence. This work was believed by Murry to be his greatest."}

{"This is a letter from Ferguson to Home discussing the attempt by their mutual friend George Johnstone to find a seat in the general election of September 1780. Ferguson mentions a letter addressed to Home that had arrived at Edinburgh in Home's absence, and writes of a meeting on Saturday, 'most of the Day', with the letter's author, 'Our Friend', a political figure aspiring to office who had been overlooked. 'Our Friend' may be George Johnstone, who is mentioned by name later. Ferguson hopes for success from 'the Endeavours which I trust are still making in his Favour. Ferguson is glad to see J:M: does not drop the Oar'... J:M: probably being James Macpherson, author of the Ossian, and friend of both Ferguson and Home. Macpherson also knew Johnstone, having been secretary to Johnstone when he was governor of West Florida. There is the possibility too that J:M: could be John Macpherson MP for Cricklade, though he had no obvious connection with Johnstone."}

{"The philosopher and historian Adam Ferguson was born at Logierait, Perthshire, on 20 June 1723. He was educated at home, locally in Logierait, and in Perth. He studied at St. Andrews University, taking his M.A. in July 1742. Studies in divinity followed, first at St. Andrews, then at Edinburgh University. An army career followed, and then he embarked on a literary career. Briefly Ferguson held the post of Librarian at the Advocates' Library in succession to David Hume (1711-1776). In 1759 he was appointed as Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University, and in 1764 to the Chair of the now obsolete Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy. In 1778, he was appointed as Secretary to the Commissioners to the American Colonies. Ferguson retired from the Chair of Moral Philosophy in 1785, but so that he could still draw a salary he was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. Professor Adam Ferguson died at St. Andrews on 22 February 1816. John Home (1722-1808), a close friend of Ferguson, was a Scottish minister, writer and playwright, and graduate of Edinburgh University, 1742. His first play, Agis: a tragedy, founded on Plutarch's narrative, was finished in 1747. His tragedy of Douglas was first performed in 1756 in Edinburgh. Other works were his tragedy The Siege of Aquileia (1760), the tragedy The Fatal Discovery (1769), Alonzo (1773), and Alfred (1778)."}

{"The British publishing firm of Nelson began as a small bookselling business established in Edinburgh in 1789. The founder of the bookshop was Thomas Neilson (1780-1861). Neilson extended his interests to include publishing, beginning with the publication, in monthly parts, of Bunyan's 'The Pilgrim's Progress'. In 1818, the name of the firm was changed to Thomas Nelson because of the tendency among customers to misspell Neilson. In 1835, Thomas was joined in the business by his son William and a little later by his younger son Thomas. The business, located in Edinburgh's West Bow, grew on the formula of reprinting standard authors at low prices, and opened branches in London and New York. In 1858 the name of the firm changed to Thomas Nelson and Sons. In Edinburgh during 1845-46, the firm moved to larger custom-built premises at Hope Park just to the south of the city centre. There, with a workforce of 600, all the activities connected with the production of books were carried out under one roof: printing, stereotyping, bookbinding, lithographing, engraving, woodcutting, warehousing, and even dyeing of the plain white calico used in bindings. From 1856, colour-printing became a feature of their production and by 1860 the firm was the leading publisher of cheap colour-printed titles. From his earliest years with the firm, Thomas exhibited a mechanical bent and in 1850 he invented a rotary press with curved stereotyped plates fixed on cylinders and with a continuous web of paper - the type of press used in the newspaper industry well into the 20th century. Nelson's production focused on story books, religious books and books of travel and adventure by popular authors, particularly intended for young readers. A series of school books was initiated, and after the Education Act of 1871, which had prompted a demand for improved school-books, Nelson's began their series of Royal readers. John Buchan (1875-1940), writer of fiction and history, was a literary adviser and the firm also published his work. Other authors published include Bagehot, Belloc, G.K.Chesterton, Erskine Childers, H. J. Newbolt, Mark Twain and H.G. Wells."}

ERCC and other early University computing entities were staffed primarily by physicists who wanted to advance their theoretical research and also embraced the idea of working with industry partners. One of the early Directors of the ERCC was Dr. G. E. (Tommy) Thomas, appointed in 1966. In the 1960s too, many computer scientists recognised the use of computers in literary and linguistic research.A significant hub of the ERCC was located at Bush between the late 1970s and the early 1990s, with a mainframe computer running the unique Edinburgh Multi Access System (EMAS) operating system. The ERCC supported the introduction of the IMP80 standard which had been a consolidation of the diverged Edinburgh IMP and IMP7. Edinburgh IMP was a development of ATLAS Autocode.2004 saw the retiral of Neil Hamilton-Smith who had arrived at Edinburgh University's Computing Services in August 1967 as a trainee programmer.

He discusses possible reasons for the connection between intelligence, education, and family size, exploring whether this phenomenon is due to genetics, environment, or both. He refers to intelligence testing he has conducted throughout several counties in England, including that of an English mining community and a concurrent test on Fatherless children; and testing carried out by the Mental Defective Committee establishing an increase in the incidence of mental defect.

Thomson charts how educational science has progressed, due in part to the use of mathematical statistics and the increasing use of quantitative measurements. He cites the application of statistical tests to the results of educational experiments to determine their significance as an example. Thomson looks closely at the issue of nature versus nurture, making particular reference to the Scottish Mental Surveys, and studies carried out on siblings and twins. He talks about both the usefulness and limitations of intelligence testing, and the possibilities of factor analysis in identifying the different abilities within an individual's mind. He describes some issues he thinks are worthy of investigation by educational science, including the notion of transfer beyond school, selection for secondary school and further education, techniques for memorising in the classroom, and propaganda in the classroom.", 'Inscribed To Jennie from The Children .', 'Inscribed Monday 17 January 1955.

He opines that musical ability is correlated with mathematical and logical ability, and links early acquisition of complex rhythms to later mathematical ability.', "The lecture largely concerns how selection for university entrance can be made more fair and equal, beginning at the age of eleven with the eleven-plus examination which determines a child's entry into a grammar or a modern school, the latter of which removes the possibility of attending university. Thomson argues for a mechanism by which pupils wrongly rejected by grammar schools may still enter university. He discusses the influence of industry and character on examination and future success, and the merits of examinations versus teachers' opinions as predictors of future success. Thomson defends and praises the use of examinations as favourable to nepotism, but discusses how the examination process could be improved upon. He describes a system of school selection used in Saxony, Germany, in 1933, which combined an examination similar in structure and content to an intelligence test, with the schools' opinion of its candidates. He contrasts this to the American state universities, which have a list of affiliated schools which can recommend students to pass into the Freshman year with no examination. Thomson also discusses the use of intelligence tests in selecting candidates for university entrance in order to make a first reduction of the suitable candidates, but stresses this method could not be used on its own for selection. In relation to this, he discusses his specific experiences at Edinburgh University of testing almost the complete entry in 1950 to the faculties of Arts, Science, and Medicine with an Adult Intelligence Test.

Thomson relates this creed back to educational systems and problems, summarising the sometimes conflicting demands each section of the community has of education: school pupils, parents, employers, communities, and government. He touches on the importance of literacy and the attitudes of the ruling classes to its rise, as well as the issue of propaganda in schools.', "Thomson defends examinations, discussing their impartiality, fairness, and showing their importance in a democratic society where individuals progress by merit rather than nepotism. Additionally, Thomson also acknowledges the problems of examinations – namely nerves; chance and luck; time pressures on both examinees and examiners; and the inconsistent relationship between examination performance, the school record, and teachers' own ratings. He discusses possible solutions to these problems, citing the marking of the eleven-plus examination in Darlington and Brighton respectively as solutions to the latter.

Thomson examines each of these three uses in turn, citing examples of the use of intelligence tests in England and Scotland. He explores some of the problems of testing for selection to secondary school, in particular the possibility of coaching and the need to ensure a steady supply of new, standardised intelligence tests each year. He outlines the standard contents of Moray House Tests and the procedure of trialling the tests to establish their suitability as well as norms within and between age groups. He also touches upon the influence of level of schooling on intelligence test performance, as illustrated by an often negative correlation between age and intelligence within a school year group.

Also includes the original leather case, which is dark green in colour.', 'Thomson outlines some current problems in education, the most pressing of these arising from the raising of the school leaving age to 15. He briefly alludes to how the practical problems of the supply of specialist teachers and of buildings could meet the increased demand, before outlining his opinion on what secondary education should entail. He highlights the need for both vocational and cultural education in schools to ensure pupils of all abilities are prepared for the working world, whatever their profession or vocation. Thomson dispels the belief that cultural education is superior to that of vocational, and stresses that the two should not be in competition with one another, giving examples from the Youth Movement in Germany and successful trade schools in Germany and America, and strongly advocating the need for industry and education to be in closer contact. However, he also emphasises the importance of culture to an individual as part of their leisure time and the character-training role of education, enabling future employees to become balanced, satisfied individuals, and in turn better and more co-operative members of society. Equality is a pervading theme of the lecture, with Thomson stressing that exams, despite their pitfalls, eliminate nepotism. He discusses the positive implications of a common school for all which still makes provision for individual ability, giving examples from across continental Europe. He argues that society should continue to strive to ensure educational equality, even in the face of the differential birth rate.', 'This lecture is essentially the same in content as lecture titled Some National Problems of Today: Education, with a shortened introduction.', "Reprint of Peel's A Short Method for Calculating Maximum Battery Reliability, from Nature, vol. 159, p.816.", "Reprint of Spearman's article, Theory of General Factor, from the British Journal of Psychology, vol.

He illustrates the wideness of the intellectual range within the population by reproducing Cyril Burt's table, Distribution of Intelligence among Children and Adults, which contains suggested IQ scores for different levels of schooling and occupational complexity in England. Thomson gives examples of individuals at the extreme ends of intelligence, referring to precocious children, and to a report by the Mental Deficiency Committee on the prevalence of feeble-mindedness in the general population. He argues that this range is both inevitable and vital for society's progress. Thomson then talks about the measurement of intelligence and stresses that we cannot fully differentiate human intelligence differences into classes, because in reality no such distinctions exist. Instead, intelligence tests identify an individual's position on a continuum. Thomson ends with a discussion of the idea of selection, emphasising that it is often wrongly thought of as a process of exclusion, when in fact it should regarded and used as part of the process in establishing the correct path for the student, taking into account both their abilities and their interests. In this process, the educators have a social and professional responsibility to guide them in establishing the correct path for them as individuals. He argues that selection should be based not on a single test but following consideration of the pupils' performance throughout their primary school career.", 'Thomson has annotated the reverse side with a matrix calculation. Additionally, Lady Thomson added annotations c1950s regarding David Somervell, who is mentioned in the letter, and his relationship with Thomson.', 'Myers refers to the work discussed in the book - the testing of 870 children in Scotland born in Scotland on the 1st of February, May, August, and November 1926, who were given a Binet test and 8 performance tests between 1935-1937. He thanks Thomson for sending him a copy of the book, and concludes that it was worthwhile work, though the tests were not designed for factor analysis and are not suitable for measuring what he describes as practical intelligence.', "Jeffrey's paper, The Law of Error and the Combination of Observations, from Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, no. 777, vol. 237, pp.231-271.", "The lecture outlines how science can fulfil its main purpose, in Thomson's opinion, that of uniting society. Thomson describes his own education – both formal and informal – and his current role as a lecturer in education, and explains how these have informed his beliefs regarding scientific training. He makes the case that science has often operated in isolation both from the world around it, and from the native language of its practitioners, with science students dependant on the language of symbols and formulae and incapable, or unwilling, to render their ideas into English. He stresses the importance that science should be taught in such a way as to enable the student to see its relevance to the wider world and to culture; and the importance that students are not taught to simply accept hypothesis and formula without understanding or questioning.", 'Includes journal articles, pamphlets, and conference papers. The vast majority of these regard either education, intelligence, psychology, or statistics. However, Thomson has, in some instances, collected articles which refer to these themes indirectly - e.g., the use of statistics in insurance.', "Thomson stresses the need for more investment and energy to be put into vocational education, looking to America as an example. He emphasises the imbalance of educational investment between the average student versus the above average or the mentally impaired student, arguing that all 3 should receive the same investment, though the methods and curriculum may be different. He proposes the creation of secondary schools equipped for vocational training and apprenticeship, staffed by individuals trained in a trade, but also as teachers, to replace the current evening or day release classes. He gives examples from Germany and Britain of close liaison and co-operation between industry and educators, and cites the Air Training Corps and scheme of National Certificates as existing British foundations to build upon. Thomson argues that whatever education a student receives, it should be grounded in reality and their interests, and thus prepare them for work. He emphasises the need for career guidance for students and good methods of selection into trades, pleading the case that students' abilities and talents be considered throughout their school career rather than from a single test. He also stresses the need for information and individual tests to be made freely available in a centralised place to better facilitate students going into professions and vocations suited to their abilities and interests.", 'Contains minor annotations by Thomson correcting one table and highlighting another.', "Giles refers to Thomson's humanity and warmth.", "The lecture charts Thomson's life and career.

Thomson refers to inquiries carried out by him in Northumberland in 1922, and inquiries carried out in the Isle of Wight in 1924, which demonstrated that individual differences outweigh social differences, and supported the notion that heredity plays more part than environment in determining intelligence. He addresses the problem of the differential birth rate, arguing that the best defence against this is mankind's differences, and these should be encouraged by equality in education, allowing secondary schools to be a mixture of abilities and talents opposed to segregation of intelligence.", 'Rough notes which take the form of lists of topics and corresponding examples Thomson wishes to discuss, and includes notes regarding different mental tests; genetic aspects of intelligence; social classes; and vocational selection.', "The notes explain Horner's method, and provide examples.", 'Thomson has typed a small revision on the piece, noting the preference of the phrase singly-conforming to non-conforming.', 'Wootton asks for further information regarding the increase in intelligence rating shown by the second Scottish Mental Survey in 1947.', "Blacker expresses his regard for Thomson and regrets not having seen more of him.

He illustrates this point with detailed descriptions of the Rachel MacMillan Nursery School in Deptford, London, and the Training School for Village Teachers at Chapra, Bengal. The former, Thomson argues, demonstrates a happy, clean environment for 350 young children while the latter represents an ambitious attempt to train teachers to act as broader welfare workers to improve conditions for entire village communities.', "Contains 3 short notes in the margin by Thomson, one comparing the histogram Thomson reproduces, titled Simpson's data, mental tests, to that of Constance McDavey in the British Journal of Psychology, 1926, XVII (i), p37; and two very short notes referring to an issue of Proceedings of the Royal Society, and page 43 of Spearman's Abilities of Man.", 'Thomson compares the American high school system to the English secondary school system. He argues that there is much to be learned from the American system which, as a result of offering a free education up to 18 for all who wish it and are able, relies on a more varied curriculum which incorporates social and vocational education alongside more academic subjects such as English, Mathematics, classics and science. Thomson reasons that more provision should be made in England for average students who wish to learn vocational subjects. He makes a case for a school model similar to that of America. However, rather than having students of different ability in the same schools, which he argues lowers existing standards, he proposes new schools should be created for the purpose of teaching more social and vocational subjects as in America He also discusses the finance of education – both secondary schools and universities – in America, with particular reference to variation between States; the fact of compulsory military training at some free State universities and private schools; and the American technique of "work-study-play" or platoon schools, in which children change activity and location throughout the school day.', "The letter is brief.

Thomson showed academic promise from an early age, winning a scholarship for Rutherford College; passing the London Matriculation exam, which enabled him to return to High Felling Board School as a pupil teacher; and coming third in the UK wide Queen's Scholarship, which allowed him to continue his studies in Armstrong College, Durham University. Thomson studied for his teaching diploma and a joint Mathematics and Physics degree simultaneously, graduating with Distinction. He went on to study at Strasbourg under the Nobel prize winning physicist, Professor Ferdinand Braun, graduating Summa cum Laude following his work on Herzian waves. After gaining his PhD, Thomson returned to Newcastle, attaining the post of assistant lecturer at Armstrong College in order to fulfil the obligations of his scholarship. It was here he met his wife, Jennie Hutchinson, a fellow lecturer, whom he married in 1912. Their son, Hector, was born in 1917. In 1916, Thomson published a paper which would ignite a 30 year debate with psychologist, Charles Spearman. The debate centred on Spearman's Theory of Two Factors, which attributed intelligence to a single, general factor, g and a large number of specific mental skills. Thomson provided an alternative for this in his bonds model, in which tests of intelligence sampled pools of bonds, with those tests that sampled the more closely-related pools having the higher correlations (Thomson made a link between these bonds and the neurons of the brain). Thomson had no wish to discredit Spearman's theory, rather to provide an alternative, and he held off publication during the war years to enable Spearman, who was serving, time to respond. In 1921, the local authorities of Newcastle, who provided bursaries for secondary school education, were concerned by a lack of applicants from rural backgrounds. Thomson was asked to design a test which would make selection a more fair process. Conscious of the fact that rural children were often absent from school, he aimed to create a test which allowed children to demonstrate their native wit or innate intelligence, rather than past learning. In 1925, despite pressure from Edward Lee Thorndike to accept a post at Columbia University following a highly successful year there as visiting Professor (1923-1924), Thomson accepted both the Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and the post of Director of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre, Moray House (later Moray House College of Education). The two positions had never been held by the same candidate, and never were again. It was here in what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit that Thomson and his team formulated the Moray House Tests, based on Thomson's earlier Northumberland tests. The tests were used throughout the UK for School selection, particularly in England, and by 1948 had been given to two out of three British children. Thomson believed testing was preferable to nepotism, and worked on making the tests as fair as possible. Profit was put in a research fund to facilitate their continued improvement. In 1931, the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) set up the Mental Survey Committee. This was in response to the International Conference on Examinations, which had been attended by representatives from Scotland, Switzerland, England, France, Germany, and the United States of America. The purpose of the conference, which was supported by Carnegie Foundation and the International Institute of Teachers College, Columbia University, was to explore international concerns regarding the validation of examinations for school assessment and selection. It was decided that each country should undertake a research exercise. The Scottish Mental Survey, a test of the entire nation's intelligence, was Scotland's unique contribution. Thomson was at the centre of this project – not only was his Moray House Test No. 12 selected for the survey, he was also assistant Chair of the committee. On June 1, 1932, almost every Scottish child born in 1921 was tested. 87,498 Scottish children in total sat down to the test. By 1947, Thomson was Chairman of the Mental Survey Committee, and the exercise was repeated for school children born in 1936, with the addition of questionnaires which gleaned data regarding the child's social, familial, and economic background. The purpose of this second survey was to measure whether Scotland's intelligence had decreased in response to the perceived differential birth rate. The results were surprising, showing a slight increase in intelligence. Intelligence and its measurement would fascinate Thomson throughout his career, and his talents in that area would see his work lauded by renowned figures such as Carlos Paton Blacker, Cyril Burt, Karl Pearson, and Sir Edmund Whittaker. He published prolifically on intelligence, statistics, and education through journal articles and books. His book, the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, ran to 5 editions (1939-1951), and was seen as a definitive authority on factor analysis. Its publication was facilitated by the Carnegie Corporation, which awarded Thomson a £5000 grant on the endorsement of E L Thorndike, and Thomas S Arbuthnot. Thomson was also the co-founding editor, alongside Cyril Burt, of the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology. Alongside this, Thomson held great passion for teaching and the imparting of knowledge. His beliefs regarding the importance of engaging students and pupils in lectures and classes, now common place, were highly innovative in his time. He strove to ensure that each individual would be put on the path suited to both their abilities and interests, which he believed would ultimately produce satisfied individuals, and subsequently good citizens. Thomson had several honours bestowed upon him during his lifetime, including fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1926; Third Class of the Order of Polonia Restituta conferred by the President of the Polish republic in recognition of his services to Polish interests during the war, 1944; Presidency of the British Psychological Society, 1945-1946; honorary membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1947; and a Knighthood for services to Education, 1949. On his retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1951, Thomson, who had proved highly popular amongst staff and students, was presented with 2 portraits of himself by R H Westwater, one of which hangs in Moray House to this day. He continued to publish up until his illness and subsequent death on 9 February 1955 in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. His wife, by then Lady Thomson, received numerous letters from Thomson's acquaintances, contemporaries, former pupils, and friends, many of which survive in his collection, attesting to his scientific achievements as well as his humanity.", 'Delivered to the [Royal] Institute of Public Administration, Northern Regional Group, Newcastle.', 'Labelled Apparently some chapters, amounting to about 160 printed pages, of a general book on education projected by my Father around 1930.

There are card indexes for Mitchell's research on Monboddo; letters and papers on his Monboddo research; newspaper and other cuttings on Monboddo; and, genealogical material relating to Monboddo. There is an album of Christmas cards, Victorian and Edwardian ephemera, postcard albums, and material on the history of Dundee. There are personal papers too, and Mitchell's academic hoods. At Gen. 1948 there are poems and an essay offered for prizes at Oxford, a typescript on paganism, a fragment of a novel, a typescript for a play, a verse drama, and printed material. At E67.32a there is a collection of papers containing the typescriptsMorte d'Arthur - a play in four actsand Tyrtaeus, or, the Future of War Poetry. The former typescript, from 1922, is a play reflecting young ex-servicemen's attitude to war and the older generation. (Mitchell had noted this in the Rectorial Address of Sir James Barrie delivered at St.Andrews University in May 1922 and which was published in Courage, and he used an incident related by Barrie on p.32 of the address). The latter typescript, Tyrtaeus, written in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1928, was intended as one in a series of books to be published by Kegan Paul. These papers also include a letter from publishers Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co. Ltd. to Mitchell, dated 16 March 1928. It thanks him for sending them the essay on the future of war poetry, but offers regret that they were not of the opinion that the book would meet with sufficient sales to render it a suitable volume for their To-day and To-morrow series. It recommended an approach to the Hogarth Press."}

{"William Fraser Mitchell was born in Dundee in 1900. He was educated at Dundee High School, leaving in 1918. In January 1919 he matriculated at Edinburgh University, studying English. He graduated with First Class Honours in 1922 and then went on to Exeter College, Oxford, researching English rhetorical preaching in the seventeenth century. He was awarded the degree of B.Litt., and was later successful in publishing his workEnglish pulpit oratory from Andrewes to Tillotson: a study of its literary aspects(1932). After Oxford, Mitchell studied Education at Moray House and Edinburgh University, and became personal assistant to Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson (1925-1951). After a temporary post as Lecturer in English at Armstrong College, Newcastle, he was appointed Lecturer in Education at the University of Reading in 1928 where he remained until 1944. A secondment to Farnborough Grammar School as an English master was followed by his appointment as Professor of Education in the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham, where he instructed teachers of religious knowledge, missionary teachers, overseas student teachers, Froebel students, and youth leaders. With the closure of the Department of Education at Selly Oak in 1951, Mitchell took a post as Assistant Lecturer in English at Huddersfield Technical College, but in 1955 he returned to the Midlands to take part in the establishment of the Malayan Teachers' College in Wolverhampton. There, three hundred students flown over from Malaya were trained for secondary school teaching. He then returned to Huddersfield Technical College for a time, was a Lecturer at the University of Sheffield, 1957-1958, and until his retirement in 1965 was an Assistant English Master at Colne Valley High School. In addition to his study of comparative education, religious education and comparative religion, Mitchell was interested in the life of James Burnett, Lord Monboddo (1714-1799). When he retired to Dundee, he took up his research again and involved himself in church work. He published collections of poetry including Off parade and other verses (1919), Cobweb and mustard seed (1928), and A slim volume(1960). William Fraser Mitchell died in July 1988."}

{"Jacobus Louw Potter was born on 21 November 1924 in Cardenden, Fife. His birth was announced in the Births column of the Scotsman on the same day - Saturday 22 November 1924 - as that of his future wife Elizabeth Ross. He was the son of a miner who became a church minister. Potter was educated at Beath High School, and he studied at Edinburgh University graduating in 1948 with the degrees of M.B., Ch.B.

{"Calton Jail was situated on the southern side of Regent Road under the shadow of Calton Hill. At the time of opening for its first prisoners in 1817, this new jail was the largest in Scotland. It had been constructed to replace the ageing and dilapidated Old Tolbooth on the High Street as Edinburgh's main correction facility.It is believed that the jail's architect Archibald Elliot designed the building in a distinctive castellated fashion so that it matched the style of other structures in the area such as the Robert Adam debtors jail of 1791 known as 'the Bridewell' and James Craig's Old Observatory on top of Calton Hill."}

{"The letter from Professor J. R. R. Tolkien is dated 28 July 1973, and is written at Merton College, Oxford. It is a letter of thanks for the honour bestowed on him in Edinburgh. The letter is addressed to 'Dear Professor Campbell', being Professor Ian M. Campbell, at the then Faculty of Arts (Latin, Humanity).The letter was written some two weeks after the event (award of Honorary Degree), and 'after some further travelling'. Tolkien expresses his thanks to Campbell for his 'part in the events [..] both in feasting and in ceremonial'. This had been 'the most resplendent academic occasion' in which he had taken part. He survived the festivities 'with unmarred pleasure, owing to the generous substitution of whisky for wine'. He refers to confirmation of his doctor's advice to 'transfer allegiance wholly from Bacchus to Ceres'.Tolkien makes some literary references to his own work in the letter. 'At the laureation', he writes, 'I felt like a hobbit would : as is exhibited [...] especially by Merry and Pippin : great pride and delight in the reception of high honour and title'. Great pride and delight 'combined with [...] a difficulty in believing that it was really happening to me, or was really deserved...'.

{"Content Description Donaldson's School (now located in Linlithgow, West Lothian) was founded in 1851 and was originally housed in the Donaldson's Hospital Building in West Coates, Edinburgh. The school and building had been financed by Sir James Donaldson (1751–1830), who was sometime publisher of the Edinburgh Advertiser a city newspaper (1764-1859) which later merged with the Edinburgh Evening Courant.Applications to the School on behalf of deaf children were encouraged, and from 1938 pupils were exclusively deaf. In 1938, the Royal Institute for Deaf and Dumb, Edinburgh (founded in 1824), was merged into Donaldson's School.The A-listed Donaldson's Hospital building was designed by architect William Henry Playfair in the Gothic style inspired by Elizabethan manor houses. The building is built round a quadrangle in Tudor architecture style with large corner towers which themselves are each made up of four smaller towers. The Hospital was opened by Queen Victoria in 1850.The new Donaldson's campus opened in Linlithgow in January 2008."}

{"Addressed from Port Philip Heads, Melbourne, 10 July 1855, the autograph letter signed by Sir Charles Hotham (then lieutenant governor of the Australian colony of Victoria) is to the geologist Sir Roderick Murchison (1792-1871).The letter begins with Hotham assuring Murchison that with regard to the 'pretensions' of 'Mr. Clarke' (meaning the geologist William Branwhite Clarke, 1798-1878), in claiming to have made the first discovery of gold in Australia, he is 'delighted' that Murchison has 'not allowed his assertions to remain uncontradicted'. Hotham continues by stating, 'I have always considered that your deductions on the probability of gold being procurable in Australia from what you knew to exist in the Ural mountains is one of the most singular occurences on record ...'.Hotham then offers some comments on the progress of gold mining in Australia: 'gold continues to spread ... four new gold fields have been discovered this year, besides gold quartz veins innumerable, the last one supposed to be the richest in the known world, and extensive investments are being made in them. Machinery – crushing and puddling are largely at play in our gold districts, art & skill, instead of more rude manual labours are being employed. Neither you or I will see a decrease in the exportation of gold from this colony, but we shall see what is worse ... a decrease in our own fortunes from its superabundance ...'.Clarke's discovery of gold in 1841 west of Sydney in the Blue Mountains was considered to have primacy over the then competing claims of Murchison, Lhotsky and others."}

{'Originally called Blair Bog, the Whim estate was purchased circa 1730 by Archibald, Earl of Islay, afterwards the 3rd Duke of Argyll. The dwelling house on the estate, Whim Hall, was erected 1731-34. It is set amidst 20 acres of striking country woodland in the Scottish Borders. Both William Adam and John Adam had influenced the building operations. James Montgomery (1721-1803) purchased The Whim from the 4th Duke of Argyll in 1763. In 1775 Montgomery he was created Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and 1st Baron Stanhope.From the turn of the 19th century the house was in the possession of John Maitland Thomson (1847-1923), Curator of Historical Records, and then Deputy Keeper of the Records in Edinburgh.

{"Content Description 7 x diary volumes, bound by Asprey in dark green morocco, titles to spines and front boards gilt. Each volume with one page per day and additional blank pages at the rear.The 7 x diary volumes, taken as a whole, present a vivid, evocative and informative picture of the life of the British expatriate merchant community in Japan in the period immediately following the First World War, brutally interrupted by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1 September 1923. The 1923 diary entries of father (James Tennant) and daughter (Sheena Kendall) compliment one another well.1919 - The earliest volume begins in London with Sheena Kendall working in Euston. Much of her spare time is taken up by socialising or in musical pursuits. She married her husband 31 July 1919, and after a honeymoon on Loch Goil, they set off for Japan from Purfleet on 2 October 1919 arriving in Kobe on 4 December.1920 onwards - early entries are dominated by descriptions of the voyage and the ship and the new life among the foreign residents of Kobe. There is little interplay with the Japanese and socialising is only within the privileged community of colleagues and other expatriots, though there are excursions around Kobe, and to Osaka and Hong Kong. The architecture appeals to Kendall as is evident from an excursion to Nikko.1923 - James Tennant outlines his daily life touching upon work, social life, sports and music, and he indulges the latte rinterest by visiting concerts with his daughter. Life is brutally interrupted by the Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923. Sheena Kendall writes: 'Poured with rain all night and blowing pretty hard this morning. After breakfast the Tebbutts, Mrs Edgar and I struggled out and baled the boats and got the rowing boat and the canoe up on the beach as it looked very typhoony'. At this time she is at Hakone, close to the epicentre... 'The earthquake happened shortly after this - at 11.55 - in which the house collapsed and I nearly lost my life in it - The Tebbutts were both killed in the hotel to which they had gone to see someone'.James Tennant offers a sense of the scope of the catastrophe. On 1 September he describes his experience in his office in Kobe...: 'Rose as usual - to busy morning in office - about noon I was standing talking to the shroff [i.e. cashier] when I suddenly felt faint and started to sway about for a few seconds - this was an earthquake...'. News of the disaster does not reach him until 2-days later. While onboard a train, he finds 'an atmosphere of panic about the earthquake - Japanese papers say Yokohama and Tokio totally destroyed, including Hakone...'.1924 - On 1 January 1924, Sheena Kendall returns to her diary and writes...: 'After a lapse of four months in which I ceased writing this diary I must make a fresh start with a new year. My last entry was at Hakone at about 11 o'clock on the morning of September 1st. An hour later I came as near to a violent death as I trust I ever shall...'.By early March 1924, the Kendalls are getting ready to leave Japan. The sail for UK end-March and arrive at Tilbury on 9 May 1924."}

{"The papers, which are substantial, deal almost exclusively with Appleton's scientific work. There is little personal or private correspondence and almost no surviving material, apart from lectures, speeches and addresses, relating to his public life as scientific administrator or university principal. There are, however, a good run of diaries and engagement books and extensive folders of notes, research ideas, manuscript calculations and data from all periods of Appleton's career, as well as much additional data contributed by assistants or from observatories. The correspondence includes an extended exchange of letters with B. van der Pol, 1921-1924, on oscillations and non-linearity, and long and frequent exchanges with long-term friends and collaborators such as W.J.G. Beynon, R. Naismith and W.R. Piggott. Appleton's collection of reprints, preprints and limited circulation reports also includes some important items.Click HERE to see a detailed handlist."}

{"Derek Salman Pugh was a psychologist, business theorist and Emeritus Professor of International Management at the Open University. He was born in Tottenham, London, on 31 August 1930. Pugh was an Edinburgh University alumnus - M.A. (Psychology) 1953, M.Sc.(Industrial sociology) 1956 - and he earned his DSc in 1973 from the University of Aston. In the 1960s he had moved to the London Business School, where he became Britain's first professor of organisational behaviour. In 2009 the Aston University awarded him an Honorary Doctorate (DLitt). He is known for his work in the field of organisational development (OD), and particularly for the 'Pugh Matrix', a tool within OD.Pugh had collected this material relating to the Edinburgh University Dramatic Society of which he had been a part while at Edinburgh University in the 1950s. The EU Dramatic Society had been founded in 1896, and lives on today in the Edinburgh University Theatre Company (EUTC).In 1957, Pugh directed the Edinburgh Graduate Theatre Group production of Venus Observed staged at the University Theatre Adam House, as well as producing The Wild Duck by Ibsen earlier in 1952 with the EU Dramatic Society. His 'Company' also put on a production of Maria Marten, or Murder in the old red barn, 1954. He also directed The Male animal in 1954. Derek Salman Pugh died on 29 January 2015."}

There is also note of '5-30pm', which is a repeat of the start time in the printed content of the 'list'. The name 'Berry' may be a misinterpretation however... perhaps it is 'Barry' referring to the shooting-range at Buddon Point, Barry, near Carnoustie, Angus.The page appears to have been clipped shorter.The Fixtures are to take place over the period Monday 31 January to Friday 4 March 1938. Teams of 8 firers compete from the 'Arty' (Artillery), Engineers, Infantry, R(D)VC, and Medical units.Matthews et. al. describe the R(D)VC OTC contingent as a Cavalry unit - with a strong influence from the Army Veterinary Corps (AVC) - distinguishing it from the units of the EU OTC. By 1938, the Cavalry unit had become Mechanised."}

{"The Edinburgh University Officers' Training Corps is one of Scotland's oldest military volunteer Units. By 1860 undergraduates of the University had formed No.4 Company of the Queen's Edinburgh Rifles and in 1872 they also supplied recruits to the 1st Edinburgh City Royal Garrison Artillery Volunteers. A Medical Volunteer Company was also formed in 1890. In 1908, they combined to form one of the original eight University Officers Training Corps (OTC) contingents.Also in 1908, and as part of the Haldane Army Reforms, the OTC was formally established as a distinct unit in the British Army. It had the remit of supplying officers for the Special Reserve and the Territorial force.In September 1912, and against the background of Army Reform and the establishment of OTCs, the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College OTC was formed by Ainsworth Wilson FRCVS. The R(D)VC OTC dissolved over the period 1939-1941 after the outbreak of war. From 1951 when the R(D)VC was incorporated into Edinburgh University, veterinary students could join the reorganised Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt Universities OTC.In 1938 however, the EU OTC consisted of the Artillery, the Engineer, the Infantry, and the Medical Units, and was open to 'all men students'. There was an entrance fee of 7 shillings and 6 pence (10 shillings and 6 pence for the Artillery Unit). There was no charge for uniform and equipment, riding, shooting, field-days, and the annual fortnight's camp. In 1938 the camp was at Redesdale, Northumberland. Annual camps were a highlight of the R(D)VC OTC year too, and in summer 1938 that contingent camped at Aldershot.Also in 1938, on 12 May, the EU OTC Unit fired its first 21-gun Royal Salute from Edinburgh Castle on the anniversary of the Coronation. The previous year, in July 1937, the R(D)VC had been invited to join the EU OTC in providing a guard of honour for Queen Elizabeth when she was awarded the Honorary Degree of LL.D.All members of the OTC could qualify, by passing a 'Certificate A' and 'Certificate B', for a Commission in the Regular Army or the Territorial Army, or could register in the Officer Cadet Reserve. During the first year in the OTC, a member had to attend, 'in mufti', thirty parades (or fifteen if attended a school OTC) and fifteen in subsequent years. The headquarters were in High School Yards, Infirmary Street. The R(D)VC OTC was housed in the College buildings at Summerhall. Training consisted of lectures in military tactics, law, and animal husbdandry, and regular parades were held in the clinical yard at Summerhall. Instruction was given in grooming, saddling a horse, examining the parts of a rifle, and squad and arms drill. Veterinary candidates for a Commission in the Army were exempt from examination on subjects concerned with other branches of military service and were examined solely on relevant veterinary subjects.In 1938, the Commanding Officer of the EU OTC was Lieutenant-Colonel F. S. C. Moffat, D.S.O; the Adjutant was Captain C. A. R. McRae, the Seaforth Highlanders; and the Chaplain was the Rev. D. W. P. Strang, M.C. M.A. The Officers commanding the units were: Artillery – Captain C. P. Beattie (Lieutenant W. R. Logan); Engineer – Lieutenant J. Gibson; Infantry – Captain D. J. Beaton; and Medical – Major A. MacG. Duff, M.C., M.B., Ch.B. In 1938, the Commanding Officer of the R(D)VC OTC was Major John Neish Ritchie who would later on become Sir John Neish Ritchie, Chief Veterinary Officer for the UK.In a report to the University of Edinburgh Journal' in 1938 (published Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd, and on pp.283-284), the Adjutant, Captain C. A. R. McRae, noted that there was 'no full-time member of the University staff to be found amongst the officers of the Contingent' and that there wasn't any 'prospect of securing one in the near future'. He went on to say that, 'Although the Corps is now an organisation of which the University can well be proud, it does not appear to be receiving, from the University in general, the full measure of support to which it is entitled in these difficult times'. The report lists: training organised by individual units for the Victoria holiday period; drill orders carried out by the battery at Dreghorn and Habbie's Howe; a tactical exercise at Carlops; a practice camp at Redesdale; training at Chatham for the engineer unit; and, camp at Turnberry for the infantry and medical units.A contingent of the R(D)VC OTC would compete with the EU OTC contingents in the regular competitions of the Inter-Unit shooting league. The 'Fixtures list' for the Inter-Unit MacDougall Cup, referred to in this description, may have derived from either of the R(D)VC OTC or the EU OTC.The Inter-Unit MacDougall Cup was presented by Dr. Robert Stewart MacDougall, M.A. (Hons.), DSc, FRSE (1862-1947) entomologist, agriculturalist, and forest zoologist. MacDougall was a Lecturer on Agricultural Zoology and Forest Zoology at University of Edinburgh, and was Professor of Biology, Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, Edinburgh, 1903-1930."}

{"Charles August Thelander, son of Swedish migrants Elias and Karna Thelander, was born in Yangan, Queensland, Australia, in 1883. He attended local schools in Yangan and Toowoomba and began studies at the University of Edinburgh in 1902. In addition to funding from the Queensland Government for these studies, he won the Edinburgh University Vans Dunlop scholarship. Thelander graduated on 26 July 1907 with the degrees fo M.B. Ch.B., and he registered as a medical practitioner in Edinburgh on 29 July 1907.He became a House Physician, then House Surgeon, at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh shortly after, and there he met Hélène Ramuz from Switzerland who would later become his wife. In 1909 he visited Europe, including Germany, and he made a short trip to Australia returning to Edinburgh in 1910. He returned to Australia permanently in 1911 to take up a medical career in Brisbane. Also in 1911, he married Hélène Ramuz. In 1922 however, she died leaving Charles a widower with three sons (Charlie, Paul, and Digger). In 1924 he remarried. His second wife was Daphne Morgan, niece of the former Queensland Premier Sir Arthur Morgan. They had a daughter (Betty).In Brisbane, Australia, Thelander headed a group of medical practitioners - Ballow Chambers Ltd - which acquired a site on Wickham Terrace, Spring Hill, in the city, in 1924. The three-storeyed masonry office building is now heritage-listed.In later years, Parkinson's Disease gripped his life, and Charles A. Thelander died in 1959."}

A ritual text, it consists of certain sections extrapolated from the well-known Vinayapitaka that were used at meetings of the order. The section regarding higher ordination is deemed especially important. Other passages are concerned with such mundane matters as the bestowal of robes, election of elders, dedication of monasteries, settling of fast days, and release from monastic vows. Although these rules and regulations were strictly observed in other Theravada Buddhist countries, only in Burma were the manuscripts of the Kammavacha given such pre-eminence and so lavishly adorned.'}

{"This work, the greatest oriental treasure of Edinburgh University Library, is one of the supreme masterpieces of Persian book painting and one of the most important medieval manuscripts from either West or East. It was written by the historian and vizier to the Ilkhanid court, Rashid al-Din, and copied in Tabriz by the author's own scribes and illustrators. There is some debate as to the exact date of this manuscript, but it was almost certainly completed within the author's lifetime, making it one of the earliest copies in existence.This work is a world history which encompasses a range of cultures, from China in the East, to Ireland in the West, from the time of Adam. It is written in the Naskh script and contains 70 illustrated folios.", "Farmān or royal order of Emperor Akbar II dated 5th October 1807, conferring upon Colonel John Baillie of Leys, British Resident at the Court of Oudh, the three titles: 'Imād al-Daulah' (Pillar of the State), 'Afial al-Mulk Bahadur' (Most Noble Champion of the Country) and 'Arslan Jang' (Lion in Battle). It is written on gilded paper pasted on silver-printed red cloth and bears the Emperor's seal in black ink and a large tughrā' or monogram in gold and red at the top.", "The collection of over 700 oriental manuscripts includes some of the greatest treasures of Edinburgh University Library. The manuscripts are mainly Islamic, written in Arabic or Persian, but there are also Jewish Torah scolls, Buddhist texts on palm leaves and Hindu manuscripts.The Al-Bîrûnî, Rashid al-Din and Mahabharata manuscripts are the best-known items (Or Ms 161, Or Ms 20, Or Ms 510). Other treasures include a beautiful Koran (Or Ms 148) which belonged to Tipu-Sahib, Sultan of Mysore, 1749- 1799 A.D., who was killed in the battle to defend his city, Seringapatam, against the British. Arabic manuscripts include commentaries on the Koran; traditions of the Prophet; prayers; law, general history and biography; medicine, mathematics, philosophy and ethics; and, grammar, rhetoric, poetry, prose, tales, dictionary, and controversy. Persian manuscripts include theology, history, biography, and travel; mathematics and astronomy; ethics, poetry, music, composition and proverbs, tales and romances; grammar and dictionary; and, agriculture and war. Hindustani manuscripts deal with history, poetry, tales and astrology. Turkish manuscripts include material acquired in Astrakhan with several early Ottoman texts, divans of Neva'i and items of dialectical interest. There are also around 100 bundles or parcels of Buddhist works on palm leaves in Burmese, Pali, Sanskrit, Siamese, Tamil, and Tibetan; and Sanskrit charters on copper plates.", "A monumental epic (or perhaps more correctly a 'chronicle') dated as a text to about 400 BCE – 400 CE, the Mahābhārata consists of dramatic narrative and sermonising didactic on ethics and moral law (dharma) as played out in the lives of two groups of dynastic cousins who fought over control of Bhāratavarṣa, present day central north India. It is one of the two major epics of ancient India, the other being the Rāmāyaṇa. This extensive scroll, made by a workshop of scribes and painters, is inscribed with text in Sanskrit and punctuated by decorative cartouches inset with delicately rendered illustrations from the story.Sequence of miniaturesThe text is preceded by a series of 15 large miniatures, with others between the various parvans (books), as well as a series of small quatrefoil-shaped ones interspersed through the text of the Ᾱdiparvan and Sabhāparvan, as detailed below.

Originally carrying passengers and fishing products, the Alaska Steamship Company began transporting mining equipment, dog sleds, and cattle at the outbreak of the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897. It merged with the Northwestern Steamship Company in 1909, but retained its name. In the post-1945 era the company struggled to compete with the new Alaska Highway for passengers and freight.Also after the Second World War, when the freight business slowed, the company decided to focus on tourism and introduced their own older ship S.S. Alaska to the new tourist fleet in January 1946. It was later joined by the Aleutian, Baranof, Yukon, and Denali. The ships called at Ketchikan (two days journey), Juneau (three days journey) and Seward (five days journey). Intermediate ports of call included Wrangell, Petersburg, Skagway, Sitka, Cordova, Valdez, Kodiak and Seldovia. All the steamers could accommodate over 200 passengers in classes ranging from steerage to a deluxe cabin with private bath.'}

{'William Horn, of Allan Park, Stirling, was an astronomical instrument maker. Horn made improvements to the two major types of reflecting telescopes then in use in astronomy - the Newtonian, and the Gregorian.The inventor and scientist, Thomas Morton, was born in Mauchline, in 1783. He was an important figure in the scientific development of south west Scotland. His invention of a barrel loom revolutionised carpet making and brought much prosperity to the area. The idea for this invention came to him after he was asked to mend a barrel organ and he recognised that the principle of the barrel with pins could be used to produce a pattern in the making of carpets. Morton was also Instrument Maker to Sir John Ross the Arctic Explorer.Thomas Morton died in 1862, and the firm was continued by Charles Morton.T. Cooke & Sons was an English instrument-making firm, headquartered in York. It was founded by Thomas Cooke by 1837.'}

The aim of the organisation was to advance the education of the public, particularly in relation to World AIDS Day and HIV and AIDS issues.WADOC Lothian committed itself to ensuring World AIDS Day [WAD] was commemorated in Edinburgh on 1st December every year, and to promoting understanding surrounding HIV and AIDS. As part of this, the organisation ensured to provide a WAD indoor event for participants, to display and distribute information on HIV and AIDS services available in the area, organise a candle-lit march to an outdoor location for the placing of candles and standing remembrance, and provide post-vigil hospitality for participants. WADOC was responsible for launching a publicity campaign through the issue of press releases to Scottish media, and publishing and distributing posters and information to various entertainment venues, schools, health centres, libraries, and community centres amongst others, for the purpose of publicising events relevant to WAD. The organisation was responsible for raising sufficient funds to meet the costs of organising and providing the annual WAD events in Edinburgh.WADOC also encouraged other organisations to plan events around WAD, and was able to award small grants to appropriate agencies, groups and individuals for promotion, educational, and the support and care of those people living with HIV in the Lothians.WADOC operated until June 2006, when the dissolution of the organisation became official, after it was felt the charity had served its purpose in promoting and educating the public on the issues surrounding HIV and AIDS.'}

{'Manuscript petition, ink on vellum (approx. 190 x 60cm in total, consisting of four joined membranes) with 248 signatures of medical students penned underneath text of the petition, also signed and dated by "J.Weatherspoon writer to the signet," some light dustiness, several patches of discolouration, a few frayed areas at margins not affecting text.This huge vellum scroll bears the manuscript text of a petition dated 28 March 1828 signed by 248 medical students of the University of Edinburgh requesting an increase in the supply of cadavers for anatomical study.Addressed to "His Majesty\'s Commissioners for visiting the Universities and Colleges of Scotland", the text notes "that according to the established course of education in the medical schools throughout the United Kingdom a thorough knowledge of anatomy is required."Considering that "this knowledge can only be obtained through dissections", the students advise "that it is of the highest importance to the welfare and the proper culture of medical science that an ample supply of subjects for the purpose should be obtained." They continue by commenting that the scarcity of cadavers, caused principally through "want of legislative regulation ... has of late years been so great as much to impede the progress of medicine in the British schools," the "exorbitant price demanded for them" amounting "nearly to a prohibition to the study of this essential branch of medical education" and leading to "the practice of exhumation to which so many evils detrimental both to the feelings and morals of the community have been ascribed." The students finish by noting that as a result many students have "resorted to Paris and other foreign universities," requesting that the Commissioners "will grant such remedies ... as ... may seem meet."'}

{"Petition stating, 'To the Right Honorable, Honorable and Reverend His Majesty's Commissioners for visiting the Universities and Colleges of Scotland. The Humble Petition of the medical students of the University of Edinburgh humbly sheweth that according to the established course of education in the medical schools throughout the United Kingdom a thorough knowledge of anatomy is required ...' [Edinburgh, 28 March 1828].This is a document of significance in British medical history, the urgency of the students' petition aligning with the exactly contemporaneous Edinburgh murders by William Burke (1792-1829) and William Hare (b. 1792/1804) committed to supply the anatomy table of Professor Robert Knox (1791-1862).Given that at the time Edinburgh was at the forefront of British medical study it is not surprising that the practice of exhumation was prevalent in the city. The shortage of supply of cadavers was caused by the law allowing only the corpses of executed criminals to be used for medical research. The Anatomy Act of 1832 remedied the situation by permitting the legal custodian of a corpse to pass it to a medical school for anatomical study or surgical practice."}

{'Content Description This ts letter from Arthur Koestler was sent to Dr Thomas Kovari (Kövári Tamás) who had escaped from Hungary in 1956. The letter to \'Dear Mr. Koevari\' - indirectly described by Koestler as a fan - was written from the Berghotel \'Böglerhof\', Alpbach, in the Tyrol, Austria, on 2 July 1959. It is signed in Koestler\'s hand. Koestler thanks Mr. Koevari for the trouble he has taken to point out a passage... a \'howler\'.Although the title referred to is un-named, it is The Sleepwalkers, a history of man\'s changing vision of the universe, published in 1959 (London: Hutchinson).The letter states: \'The formulation on page 506 was indeed very careless\'. It goes on...: \'The "spiral" was meant metaphorically, referring to a meteor entering the earth\'s atmosphere [...]\'. Koestler tells Mr. Koevari that he hadn\'t noticed \'an even more striking howler on page 394\'.'}

{'Content Description This ms scrapbook volume of E. M. G. Colquhoun is dated, Edinburgh, 17 September 1838, at the top of a preface. The volume is in two parts; the whole item containing anecdotes, stories, poems, music and pen and ink illustrations of monuments, seals, antiques, animals, and characters.From the beginning of the scrapbook, written by Colquhoun on the 17th of September 1838: "It had always been my chief wish, from my childhood upwards, that I might have a scrap-book of my own, to be filled with selections in prose and verse. ...Having some spare time, ...about two years ago, I again thought of beginning a new scrap-book, and as I was devotedly fond of drawing, I thought that I might use this book as a sort of sketch book, where I might both improve myself in my favourite amusement, and at the same time illustrate the subjects I copied, by making pen-and-ink drawings, in my own rough way, to accompany them. These drawings are all copied from engravings, and I trust that my inexperience in the art will be a sufficient apology for the rude style in which they are executed. After having continued these extracts and drawings for about a year, circumstances came in the way, which prevented me from continuing them, and I was obliged to gather some of my old compilations together, that I might have a sufficient quantity of material to make a volume. This is the origin of my "scrap-book", and I trust that it will be found on perusal as amusing as other books of the same sort."Part 1 contains: 140pp of historical documentary articles, curiosities compiled from travelling around Britain and Europe.Part 2 contains: poems, prose articles, and some music.Throughout both parts there are fine pen/ink illustrations.'}

{"Content Description Papers - correspondence and copies of circulars - relating to a possible Oppenheim Bequest, Edinburgh University, covering the period from March 1984 to December 1986.The initial correspondence talks of the creation of 'a Memorial' to the 'close connection' of Oppenheim 'with the University and the City of Edinburgh', and how best this might be achieved. His widow - Mrs. Enid Oppenheim - 'had expressed a wish' that the Memorial could be identified with 'the training of business executives', and associated with 'Accounting, Business Studies, Industrial and other Law Classes'. The Memorial was to be known as the 'Oppenheim Bequest'. The correspondence describes the various proposals discussed... many of which appeared to have engendered doubt.The papers contain copies of material relating to: a Business Studies building... Buccleuch Church; newspaper cutting relating to business studies... MBAs specifically; Edinburgh Management School; and, an Electronic Financial Library."}
