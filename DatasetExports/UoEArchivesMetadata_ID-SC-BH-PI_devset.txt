{"The Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women (EAUEW) had its roots in the second half of the nineteenth century. The first Association of its kind in Scotland, it was involved in a flourishing campaign - part of the wider women's movement - promoting the provision of higher education for women. Prior to this, women had rarely attended University of Edinburgh lectures, although, of course, Dr James Barry had graduated M.D. from Edinburgh in 1812 - serving in the British Army as a medical officer - and on death had been discovered to be a woman. With the arrival of Sophia Jex-Blake in Edinburgh in the 1860s and the vigorous campaign for the medical education of women, the nation-wide demand for women to be offered the same educational opportunities as men - in general arts education or medical subjects - was highlighted. On 15 October 1868, the forerunner of the EAUEW was founded - the Edinburgh Ladies Education Association (ELEA) - at 1 Inverleith Terrace, Edinburgh, and the following year, in 1869, Jex-Blake won the right for women to attend medical classes in the separate Extra-Mural School. The guiding force behind the setting up of the ELEA however, was Mrs Mary Crudelius. Its aim was not to threaten any professional status, but to cultivate and improve the mind through its lectures. Crudelius and others were able to use their influence to win the guidance and advice of David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature, a prominent supporter of the women's cause. By 1873, women were enrolled in Association classes as diverse as Mathematics, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Physiology, Botany and Bible Criticism. In 1874 a University Certificate in Arts was introduced, and by 1877 the Rules and Calendar of the Association were being printed in theUniversity Calendarthus forging the link between the University of Edinburgh and the cause of women's education. With a change in name (to EAUEW) the Association continued to attract students to its classes, and to campaign to obtain a university education for women. In the end, the debate produced the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889 which led to the drawing up of Regulations for the Graduation of Women and for their instruction in the Universities, 1892. In 1893 eight women graduated from the University of Edinburgh. They had all been EAUEW students. Right from the start, classes were mixed with the exception of medical ones. With its main objective now achieved, the EAUEW turned to the provision of facilities and amenities for women. By 1897, a library and accommodation for women were available at Masson Hall, at that time located at George Square, Edinburgh. By 1914 more than a thousand women had graduated at the University. The EAUEW was wound up in the 1970s."}

{"The modern tourist centre of Vadstena in Östergötland, Sweden, with the 16th century Vadstena Slott (or Castle) built by Gustavus Vasa in 1545, was first mentioned in the early 14th century as the site of the Convent of St. Birgitta (Bridget) of Sweden, founder of the Brigittine Order and a mystic whose revelations were influential during the Middle Ages. The Convent in Vadstena was the most important medieval cloister in Sweden and was founded around 1370. Birgitta or Bridget (also spelled Birgit, or Brigid, and in Swedish Sankta Birgitta av Sverige), a patron saint of Sweden, was born around 1303. She was the daughter of Birger Persson, governor of Uppland, and in 1316 she married Ulf Gudmarsson, later governor of the province of Nericia (now called Närke). She bore eight children, including St. Catherine of Sweden. On the death of her husband in 1344, Birgitta retired to a life of penance and prayer near the Cistercian monastery of Alvastra on the lake shore of Vättern. She dictated the revelations that came to her to the prior, Peter Olafsson, and he translated them into Latin. One of the revelations was a command to found a new religious order. This she was not able to carry out until near the end of her life, receiving papal permission in 1370. Earlier, in 1350, Birgitta went to Rome and, except for several pilgrimages, remained there for the rest of her life, constantly accompanied by her daughter Catherine. In 1372 she visited the Holy Land. St. Birgitta died in Rome, Italy, on 23 July 1373 soon after her return from the Holy Land. She was canonised on 8 October 1391. The feast day associated with St. Birgitta is 23 July (formerly 8 October). Catherine, or Katarina Ulfsdotter, was the daughter of St. Birgitta, whom she succeeded as superior of the Brigittines. Catherine was born in Sweden around 1331. She married Egard Lydersson von Kyren, who died shortly after she left for Rome to join her mother as her constant companion. Catherine did not return to Sweden until after Birgitta's death in 1373. She took part in the ecclesiastical controversies of the time, supporting Pope Urban VI against the antipope Clement VII in Avignon, and she promoted the canonisation of Birgitta. Catherine was abbess of Vadstena when she died. Although she was never formally canonised, she is listed in the Roman martyrology. Catherine died in Vadstena on 24 March 1381. The feast day associated with her is 24 March (in Swedish, Sankta Katarina)."}

{"Thomas Richard Allinson held particular views on how best to restore the sick back to health again. He advocated hydrotherapy, abstention from tobacco and alcohol, fresh air, no drugs or vaccination, and a healthy vegetarian and wholemeal diet. Allinson was born 29 March 1858 in Hulme, Manchester. He went to school in Lancaster and Manchester. In 1874 he was a medical student in Edinburgh, at the Royal College of Surgeons. While in Edinburgh, he is said to have won a medal in practical chemistry, and a special prize in public health, and to have taken a double qualification as a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons and Physicians, LRCSP. After studying in Edinburgh he assisted in a general practice in Hull, followed by a visit to Paris. Around this time he became interested in hydrotherapy - the use of water in the treatment of illnesses. He was next to be found assisting in a general practice in Shoreditch where he acted as police surgeon and parish doctor. While in Shoreditch, Allinson developed an opposition to stimulants such as alcohol and tobacco, advocating abstention from alcohol consumption. Vegetarianism became an interest of his too, and he joined the Food Reform Society. In 1887, he wrote an article strongly opposed to drugs which he said were poisons, and to vaccination which he said was dangerous. Instead, he advocated a healthy diet and exercise. He was of course attacked by other doctors and, after lengthy public and professional debate over his arguments, Edinburgh's Royal College of Surgeons struck him off the roll. Undaunted, he continued to use the letters Ex-LRCP.Ed after his name. In 1890, Allinson opened the Hygienic Hospital in Willesden where patients were treated according to his principles of hygienic medicine. He wrote widely on the advantages of wholemeal bread and wholemeal and vegetarian cookery, and in 1892 he purchased a stone grinding flour mill in London's Bethnal Green. This was established as the Natural Food Company Ltd., 305 Cambridge Road, London. Allinson died in 1918 but after his death the demand for wholemeal bread continued to rise and two more mills were acquired in Newport, Monmouthshire, and Castleford, Yorkshire. Today, Allinson traditional flour is part of the product range of Allied Mills Ltd. The material known as the Allinson Papers was presented to in June 1987 by Booker Health Foods, one of the trade names of which, at that time, was Allinson. In the 1980s, the parent company of Booker Health Foods Ltd. was Booker McConnell plc, later Booker plc."}

{"James Murray was born on 28 September 1690. He was the third son of John Murray, 2nd Marquis and 1st Duke of Atholl (1660-1724). By June 1714, Lord James had reached the ranks of Captain and Lt.-Col. in the 1st Footguards (King's Company). Then came the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 in support of the 'Old Pretender', James Francis Edward Stewart (1688-1766), and led by John Erskine, 11th Earl of Mar. Lord James joined the Duke of Argyll's government forces at Perth in January-February 1716 and marched in pursuit of the Jacobites to Aberdeen. To the north, at Peterhead, the 'Old Pretender' had arrived from Lorraine just before Christmas, but with the collapse of the Rebellion he sailed from Montrose, Angus, just a few weeks later. Lord James' older brother, William Murray, Marquis of Tullibardine (1689-1746), had taken part in the indecisive Rebellion and his rights to the family honours and estates were therefore stripped from him by Act of Parliament. These would now pass to Lord James since the eldest brother, John Murray, had been killed earlier at the Battle of Malplaquet in August 1709. Meanwhile, in 1715, Lord James had been elected MP for Perthshire, and in 1722 he was chosen again. On the death of his father in 1724, he became 2nd Duke of Atholl. His rather than William's succession to the family honours and estates was confirmed by a new Act of Parliament in 1733. That same year he was appointed Lord Privy Seal. In 1734, he received the Order of the Thistle. In 1736, James Murray, now 2nd Duke of Atholl, also inherited sovereignty of the Isle of Man and an English barony through a family connection to the 10th Earl of Derby. Between 1737 and 1741 he was able to sit in Parliament both as an English Baron and a Scottish Peer. In July 1745, the 'Young Pretender' Prince Charles Edward Stewart (1720-1788) accompanied by William Murray (titular Duke of Atholl) and six other supporters landed at Moidart in the west of Scotland. Within six weeks of the raising of the Jacobite standard at Glenfinnan in August 1745, Charles had overrun Scotland and James Murray had fled southwards. The dispossessed William Murray now took possession of Blair Castle in Perthshire, the family seat. By December, the Jacobites had reached Derby, and although still undefeated they won practically no support either in the Lowlands of Scotland or in England, and they began a fateful withdrawal to Scotland. James Murray joined the army of the Duke of Cumberland in pursuit of Prince Charles and the Jacobites and arrived in Edinburgh on 30 January 1746. He continued northwards to the Atholl estates and summoned his men to attend him and to join the government troops in their march towards Inverness. In April 1746, at the Battle of Culloden, the last battle to be fought on British soil, the Jacobites were defeated. James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl, regained Blair Castle and the Atholl estates. In 1763, Murray resigned the office of Lord Privy Seal on his appointment as Keeper of the Great Seal and as Lord Justice General. James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl, died at Dunkeld, Perthshire, on 8 January 1764."}

{"The firm of Christian Salvesen Ltd. was first founded as a private unlimited company in 1872. The firm began in premises in Bernard Street, Leith, bought by Salve Christian Fredrik Salvesen, a Norwegian from Mandal, for business as a shipbroker and shipowner. Christian Salvesen had first arrived in Scotland in 1851 to manage a Grangemouth shipbroking business owned by his brother, Johann Theodor Salvesen, in partnership with the Edinburgh merchant George Vair Turnbull. The firm imported grain for domestic use and for distillation, and timber for pit-props, housebuilding, and for railway sleepers. Exports were mainly coal and iron. In addition to these commodities, the firm also dealt in cargoes of salt and Norwegian herring, and high profits were obtained from the flood of Australia-bound migrants and gold prospectors. In 1853, Salve Christian Fredrik took Johann Theodor's place as a partner and carried on in the firm until 1872 when he went into business on his own. This coincided with the advent of the steamship and the expansion of maritime commerce with German and Baltic ports following the Franco-Prussian war. Later on, in the 1880s, three of his sons would join him and carry on the business after his death in 1911. By then the firm's vessels were trading with ports on the Baltic, and in Norway and Sweden, and were servicing whaling stations in the Arctic, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Cargo lines were also opened up between Leith, Malta, and Alexandria, and then into the Black Sea. During the first decade of the 20th century, the shipping industry was in a depressed state and, globally, shipping companies made heavy losses. The Salvesen fleet fared no better, although the company's whaling interests which had expanded as far as the Falkland Islands and South Georgia did help it at times to show profit. In the early decades of that century, whaling dominated Salvesen's business and indeed the firm led the whaling industry at a time when food oils and other products from the Antarctic were considered a boundless resource. A third generation of Salvesens had entered the business in the troubled economic period of the inter-war years. The firm managed to ride these out, and in whaling it expanded and modernised. As stocks began to diminish however, the firm of Salvesen - whalers for nearly 70 years - was prominent in urging conservation. By the 1960s and 1970s a fourth generation was still playing an important role in the firm, although by then Salvesen was no longer a family firm. Diversification had been an important key to the survival of the firm over these decades, from importing and exporting of timber and coal, to whaling and a tanker fleet, shipping steel and coke to Norway for the Norwegian shipbuilding and steel industries, factory fishing trawlers, and then to shore-based cold storage, canning, property development and also to house-building. Into the 21st century it was as frozen food merchants and for the distribution of quick frozen vegetables that the name Christian Salvesen PLC had become better known. In 2005 the business was restructured into two main business segments - 'Food and Consumer' and 'Transport'. These provided outsourced supply chain operations for the food and consumer sectors including temperature controlled storage and distribution, and offered transport and warehousing for a wide range of industrial sector customers. Countries of operation comprised Belgium, France, Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. In 2006, the company employed 14,000 staff at 200 sites, in eight countries, and had revenues of £899-million. The firm had transport deals with Tesco, Marks and Spencer, Ford and BP. Then, in October 2007, the French based transport and logistics provider Norbert Dentressangle announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Christian Salvesen. As a UK-based third party logistics provider with operations throughout Europe, Christian Salvesen enabled Norbert Dentressangle to significantly reinforce its own position in Europe. Indeed, the merger between Dentressangle and Salvesen created Europe's 7th largest transport and logistics company with a fleet of more than 8,000 trucks operating from almost 400 bases in 13 countries - Norbert Dentressangle had previously been more dominant in France, Germany and eastern Europe."}

He was educated at St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews, graduating on 27 July 1661. Thereafter he may have studied at one of the English universities either as a companion or tutor to his relative, Robert of Glenorchy (Sir Robert Campbell of Glenorchy) an ancestor of the marquises of Breadalbane. In 1666 or 1667 he was admitted as minister of the Parish Church of Ardchattan and Muckairn in Lorne. On 12 January 1676 he was suspended from the ministry on a charge of pre-nuptial intercourse but was restored 25 June 1676. In addition to carrying out his professional duties, Campbell had a deep interest in mathematics and astronomy and was a correspondent of Sir Isaac Newton. Indeed, theDictionary of National Biography(1908) tells us that in a letter to James Gregory, Professor of Mathematics at Edinburgh and formerly of St. Andrews, Newton had said of Campbell, 'he would make children of us all'. From his father, Campbell inherited the farm of Drimvuick in the parish, but exchanged these for the farm of Achnaba. Campbell died 13 March 1726."}

{"The physician Richard Bright was born in Bristol on 28 September 1789. He matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1808 first with the Faculty of Arts then with the Faculty of Medicine. In 1810 came a visit to Iceland after which he contributed chapters on botany and zoology to George Mackenzie'sTravels in Iceland(1811). He then studied anatomy and surgery at Guy's Hospital and St. Thomas's, London. He also became interested in geology at this time. In 1812, Bright returned to Edinburgh, again studying medicine but also geology and natural history. He graduated with the degree of MD in 1812, having written the dissertationDe Erysipelate Contagioso. Between 1814 and 1815, he travelled to the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, and Hungary, and after his return to England he became an Assistant Physician at the London Fever Hospital. After contracting a fever himself, he began travelling again in 1818, this time to Germany, Italy and France. In 1820 he became an Assistant Physician at Guy's Hospital and then in 1824 he became a full Physician there. During these early years at Guy's, Bright gave courses on botany in relation to pharmacy, and gave clinical and medical lectures. In 1827 he published the first volume of reports of medical cases which contained his discovery of what came to be termed Bright's disease, Morbus Brightii. A second volume appeared in 1831. While at Guy's he also assisted Thomas Addison (1793-1860) in the composition of the text-bookElements of the practice of medicine(1839). On the accession of Queen Victoria, Bright was appointed Physician Extraordinary to the Queen. He retired from Guy's in 1843. In addition to the works mentioned above, he published many accounts of his travels and other medical treatises. Richard Bright died at his house in Savile Row, London, on 16 December 1858.Bright's youngest son also became a physician and practiced in Cannes in the south of France. His oldest son was James Franck Bright who was born in London on 29 May 1832. James Franck Bright was educated at Rugby and at University College, Oxford. He became a Master at Marlborough College and was Head of the Modern Department there for sixteen years. In 1872, Bright returned to Oxford this time to Balliol New College and as a History Tutor. In 1874 he was a Fellow and Dean of University College, Oxford, and in 1878 an Honorary Fellow of Balliol. Between 1881 and 1906 he was Master of University College, Oxford.

{"Nova Scotia is one of Canada's Maritime Provinces - the others being New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. It comprises the Nova Scotia peninsula, Cape Breton Island, and some adjacent islands. It has a population of around 899,900 (in 1991) and Halifax is the provincial capital. The name of the province was applied by Scottish settlers. Nova Scotia was the site of the first permanent North American settlement north of Spanish Florida. It was established at Port Royal (now Annapolis Royal) in 1605 by the French, although the territory was also inhabited by the semi-nomadic Algonquian Indian tribes of the Abnaki and the Micmac. Colonial rivalries between France and Britain throughout the 17th and 18th centuries led to instabilities in Nova Scotia and it passed backwards and forwards between the two until the Peace of Utrecht 1713 when it was retained by Britain. Cape Breton Island was kept by France. The opportunity of acquiring free land attracted many new settlers from Britain, especially from Scotland, and from New England to the south of the territory. During the American Revolution and afterwards, many United Empire Loyalists from New England came to the province. In 1769, Prince Edward Island split away from Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick followed in 1784. In 1820, Cape Breton Island was reunited with Nova Scotia. It was one of the four British colonies federated into the Dominion of Canada in 1867 - Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario. In today's Nova Scotia, only around one eighth of the population can claim descent from the French settlers. The bulk of the population is descended from British or New England settlers, though there is a very small percentage descended from Irish and German settlers. Other minorities include small numbers of Dutch, Italians, and Hungarians, who arrived after 1945. English is spoken by some 90 per cent of the population. Around 8 per cent are bilingual with French and English. Nova Scotia has been something of a pioneer in Canadian history with the country's first printing press in 1751, the first newspaper in 1752 (theHalifax Gazette), the first university in 1788-1789 (King's College, Windsor), and the first British colony to achieve cabinet government responsible to the people through elected representatives."}

As a man of means, Smith travelled widely, even commanding his own ships under a Board of Trade ticket. He also invented an instrument for computing time at sea. Between 1871 and 1882 Smith sailed in the Arctic, taking the schooner 'Sampson' to Svalbard (Spitzbergen) in 1871 and sailing there again in 1872. During these two voyages he carried out oceanographic work on the Gulf Stream, though he did not get full credit for this. In 1880, in the 'Eira', a new screw brigantine, he sailed from Peterhead towards Jan Mayen and east Greenland, and then to Franz Josef Land which had only been discovered in 1873-1874. In 1881, he sailed again from Peterhead, in Scotland, to Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land. In August 1881, the 'Eira' was trapped in the ice and sank, but Smith and his men managed to live for a time in a make-shift hut and then used the ship's boats to make for Novaya Zemlya. There they met Sir Allen W. Young (1830-1915) and his ship 'Hope'. Smith and his company arrived in Aberdeen at the end of August 1882. In 1881, he had been awarded a medal by the Royal Geographical Society for his discoveries and a paper on the 1880 exploration was read. In 1882, he was made an Honorary Fellow of Jesus College. Although he made no further explorations to the Arctic, he continued his interest in the region and in the whaling trade. Benjamin Leigh Smith died in Hampstead on 4 January 1913."}

The Malabar Coast was the scene of trade struggles in the 16th and early 17th centuries between the Portuguese and their European and Indian rivals. In the late 17th century British traders gained control of the region. The defeat of the Portuguese in India by the East India Company in 1612 had won it trading concessions from the Mughal Empire. It then acted as an agent of British imperialism in India from the early 18th century to the mid-19th century. While in his mid-teens, in 1780, Alexander Walker (born 12 May 1764) was appointed as a cadet in the service of the East India Company. In 1782 he became an ensign and in the same year took part in campaigns against the forts of Haidar Ali Khan (also spelled Hayder Ali, the father of Tipu Sahib, or Tippoo) on the Malabar Coast. Walker was also present at Mangalore during the siege by Tipu and its subsequent surrender in January 1784. In 1788, after a period in enemy hands, and after taking part in an expedition to the north-west coast of America undertaken by the Bombay government, he was made a lieutenant and was sent with the expedition to relieve the Rajah of Travancore in 1790. In 1791, he was an adjutant. On the conclusion of this stage of the war against Tipu, a commission was nominated to regulate the affairs of Malabar, and Walker was appointed as an assistant. On the arrival in Malabar of General James Stuart (d. 1793), commander-in-chief of the army in Bombay, he became his military secretary. In 1797, Walker was made captain, and the same year he became quartermaster-general of the Bombay army with the rank of major. In 1799, he took part in the last war against Tipu and was present at the fighting at Seedaseer and at the siege of Seringapatam (also spelled Srirangapatan, and also known as Shrirangapattana) during which Tipu Sahib was killed. In 1800, Walker was sent to the Mahratta states with the intention of pacifying and reforming the region and the Mahratta confederacy. Discontent in Baroda culminated in the insurrection of Mulhar Rao in 1801, though this was put down by 1802. In June 1803, Walker was appointed political resident at Baroda and he succeeded in establishing an orderly administration there. His career continued in India, and he attained the rank of lieutenant-general in 1808. In 1810 he returned to Britain, doubtless to his estate of Bowland in Edinburgh and Selkirk, and he retired from service in 1812. Ten years later in 1822 he was called back from his retirement to the government of St. Helena which was under the administration of the East India Company. There he had the rank of brigadier-general. While in St. Helena, he improved the island's agriculture and horticulture. Brigadier-General Alexander Walker died in Edinburgh on 5 March 1831."}

{"The Plinian Society in Edinburgh first met on 14 January 1823. It met at the University (then known as Edinburgh College). During the first meeting, Mr. John Baird, one of the presidents, made a statement on the 'proposed plan and objects' of the Society - to advance the study of natural history, antiquities, and the physical sciences in general. Baird also showed a collection of simple minerals, mountain rocks and shells, and Mr. Thompson showed a specimen of galena 'associated with Pearl-spar and Fluorspar'. Included among the honorary members of the Society were: Robert Jameson, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh University; Thomas C. Hope, Professor of Chemistry; Robert Graham, Professor of Botany; Sir Walter Scott; and, Sir Humphry Davy. An illustrious ordinary member of the Society was Charles Darwin (1809-1882) who was proposed by co-members Brown, Coldstream and Fife on 28 November 1826. Darwin was unanimously elected as an ordinary member, and during a subsequent meeting held on 5 December 1826 to elect office bearers he was elected to the council of the Society. On 27 March 1827, Darwin communicated to the Society two discoveries that he had made: firstly that the ova of the flustra possessed organs of motion; and, secondly, that the small black globular body hitherto mistaken for the young fucus lorius was in reality the ovum of the pontobdella muricata. The Plinian Society requested that he draw up a factual account and to submit it with specimens. Darwin did this on 3 April 1827."}

{"The Scottish Constitutional Committee was established in August 1968 by Edward Heath (b. 1916) and had the task of examining a proposal for the creation of a Scottish Assembly. The suggestion for this had been put forward by a policy group of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, but at the time the subject was being well debated across the country generally. Because of the nature of the proposal, an apolitical body was required, and the Scottish Constitutional Committee was created to act as this body. The policy group of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party was represented at the Committee's meetings. Although the Committee was financed by the Conservative Party, it was an independent organisation composed of independent members and sought to obtain and examine the views of the broadest possible spectrum of Scottish opinion. The Committee was presented with particular aims and functions. It had to keep the UK united, but try to improve the machinery of government. It had to allow the Scottish people to play a part in making decisions on Scottish legislation, and it had to increase the opportunity to propose and discuss UK policy as it affected Scotland. The Committee was free to explore any other proposals for the future government of Scotland but any solution had to be consistent with and to contribute to the unity of the UK. The Committee was chaired by Sir Alec Douglas-Home (1903-1995) and during its life consisted of thirteen separate members including Lady Tweedsmuir (1915-1978) and the Rev. Dr. Ronald Selby Wright (1908-1995) and two advisers one of whom was the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies (1894-1978). The first meeting of the full Committee was held at the North British Hotel, Princes Street, Edinburgh (now the Balmoral Hotel), on 13 September 1968, and met on seventeen occasions for twenty-one days in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Inverness and Peebles. The last meeting was held on 16 March 1970. The Committee weighed up the arguments for separatism and federalism that had been discussed widely across the country and rejected the thesis that Scottish prosperity lay in severing ties with the existing UK constitution. Instead, it proposed a Scottish Assembly or Convention of approximately 125 elected and paid members which would debate Scottish Bills in the early legislative stages of parliamentary progress. The body recommended by the Scottish Constitutional Committee was to be located in Edinburgh. The Committee Report was published in March 1970."}

Biogen had filed two second patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO) in 1978 and 1979, although the latter was only granted in 1990. The patent could be construed in such a way that it could in effect block all other ways of achieving the same result via different routes. The validity of the patent was challenged by opponents at the EPO's own tribunal, although the EPO found the patent valid on 28 July 1994.The first court in the UK to hear the dispute with Medeva was the Patents Court (part of the English High Court), where Judge Aldous found that Biogen's patent was valid and had been infringed. Medeva successfully appealed to the English Court of Appeal, which found that the patent was invalid on the grounds of obviousness and insufficiency.

One such project was the Hepatitis B project pursued by Kenneth Murray at the University of Edinburgh, which was one of the company's early scientific successes. This success hinged on the licensing arrangements under its patents relating to Hepatitis B antigens for both diagnostic and vaccine purposes. An agreement put in place with the University of Edinburgh ensured that the University would receive a proportion of the patent royalties as well as a royalty on sales of products manufactured and sold by the company. Biogen also had a Supervisory Board of Directors comprising representatives of the venture capitalist sponsors of the company, the financial community and members of the Scientific Board.Biogen opened its own research laboratories in Geneva in 1979. As the company's financial strength grew, additional laboratories were established in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This enabled Biogen to benefit from the intense scientific activity in the area of genetic engineering and related technologies in the United States, and the proximity of some of the Scientific Board members at Harvard and MIT.

{"The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902-1904) was undertaken with the sole aim of increasing and improving knowledge of polar science. Success was achieved by the production of high quality scientific results, particularly in the areas of polar oceanography, meteorology and wildlife observation. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition was conceived and led by William Speirs Bruce (1867-1921) who had training and experience in all areas of the natural sciences, and a considerable background in polar observation. He regarded the Expedition as a Scottish response to the recent 'Discovery' Expedition, on which he had turned down the position of naturalist, due to its emphasis on exploration rather than scientific observation. After failing to gain funding from the British Government, Bruce raised the cost of the expedition by private subscription. Two of the Coats brothers of Paisley donated generously providing two-thirds of the overall budget. In 1901, Bruce purchased the Norwegian whaler 'Hekla'. This was repaired and altered at Ailsa Shipbuilding Company's yard in Troon, under the free direction of the naval architect G. L. Watson. Following alteration the ship was renamed the SY 'Scotia'. SY 'Scotia' departed from Troon on 2 November 1902. On board were a crew of 25 and an impressive team of scientists recruited from amongst Bruce's friends and colleagues. These included a zoologist, a botanist, a meteorologist, a geologist, a taxidermist and a bacteriologist. The SY 'Scotia' sailed south, via Madeira and the Falkland Islands. On the way, meteorological surveys were carried out every 4 hours and the oceanographic instruments tested. Scientific studies were also undertaken at the Cape Verde Islands and St Paul's Rock. Bruce recorded events throughout the trip using a variety of methods. These included cinematography, phonography and photography using a variety of cameras. On 3 February 1903, the SY 'Scotia' arrived at Saddle Island in the South Orkney Islands, where the scientific team made their first Antarctic landing. Afterwards the SY 'Scotia' continued to progress southwards until a drop in temperature saw a short period beset in pack ice. After breaking free, the trip south was abandoned for the season. The ship progressed NNE along the pack ice before anchoring for the winter in Scotia Bay on the south side of Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands. A wooden meteorological observation station, named Omond House, and a cairn, as a reference point for topographic survey work, were constructed immediately. Over the winter, observations and collections of specimens were undertaken in a number of scientific disciplines. Small parties were sent out for short periods to enhance these. In addition, a considerable amount of topographic survey work was undertaken allowing the first map of Laurie Island to be draughted. After breaking free from the ice in Scotia Bay, on 22 November 1903, the SY 'Scotia' sailed to Argentina via the Falkland Islands. A team of 6 men were left ashore to continue scientific observations, particularly on penguins. Negotiations with the Argentine Government, to assume the responsibility for meteorological observations, were successful, and 3 Argentines returned with the ship to staff Omond House along with Robert Cockburn Mossman (1870-1940). This team was left on Laurie Island to be collected by the 'Uruguay' in December 1904. The SY 'Scotia' proceeded south into the Weddell Sea to undertake oceanographic observations. Previously undiscovered land was sighted on 3 March 1904. This was named Coats Land in honour of the Coats brothers' support of the expedition. The ship continued to edge south until meeting the ice shelf. Following a storm the ship became stuck in the pack ice at 74o | 01'S 22o | 00'W, the furthest latitude south achieved by the expedition, where it remained for 6 days. Following liberation, further oceanographic soundings were taken to compare with those recorded by James Clark Ross in 1843. The SY 'Scotia' arrived back in Scotland on 21 July 1904, having travelled via Gough Island, south-west Africa, Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Cape Verde Islands and the Azores. During the journey a number of trips ashore were taken for scientific observation and collecting, as well as recreation."}

{"Samuel Bailey was born in 1791 and was educated first by his maternal grandfather and then at the Moravian school of Fulneck. He then worked alongside his father who was a master cutler in Sheffield. He visited America to establish commercial connections, but his attentions and interests were caught not by business but by literary and political pursuits. From 1821 he began publishing essays and in 1828 he began a political career but with little success. Bailey was President of the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society and he became chairman of the Sheffield Banking Company which he had helped found in 1831. Bailey's publications includeEssays on the formation and publication of opinions and other subjects(1821),Critical dissertation on the nature, measure, and causes of value(1825),Essays on the pursuit of truth and on the progress of knowledge(1829),Rationale of political representation(1835),Theory of reasoning(1851), and in 1861 and 1862 two volumes on Shakespeare's writing.

{"The Edinburgh International Club arose out of a chance meeting in 1912 between Dr. Armistead, a senior student of medicine at Edinburgh University, his wife, and Miss A. H. Begbie an Edinburgh citizen. An invitation to Miss Begbie's home followed, and Dr. Armistead had explained to her the value of their chance meeting and new friendship and how other visitors from overseas would also value the experience of meeting local people in their own environments. Fortnightly 'at homes' for the Armisteads and overseas acquaintances resulted from this, hosted by Miss Begbie and her cousin Miss Kemp. Out of these sprang the idea for a club and on Saturday 1 November 1913 the Edinburgh International Club was formally launched. The object of the Club was to promote friendly relations and social intercourse between members of various nationalities resident in Edinburgh, and the earliest meetings of the body included representatives from fourteen different countries. Activities and events over the years included walks, folk dancing, Polish dancing, Kenyan entertainment, Ukrainian concerts, Sri Lankan evenings, and Norwegian evenings. On the 50th anniversary of the Club in November 1963, the Principal of Edinburgh University hosted an event for its membership at Edinburgh University Library, and in 1979, the 65th anniversary year, a party was held at the Triangle Coffee House, Randolph Place. By 1986 however, the Club had ceased to function because of lack of support from the overseas student body towards whom it had originally directed itself to assist."}

{"The Committee on Voluntary Organisations was set up and jointly financed by the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust and the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust to review the role and functions of voluntary organisations in the UK over the remainder of the 20th century. The Committee was appointed on 1 October 1974 and was composed of members from all over the UK but with none 'carrying a banner, political, geographical or professional' (according to the published report, p.9). Members of the Committee, serving as individuals rather than as representatives of any bodies or organisations, set about gathering their evidence from both questionnaire and discussion. In response, over three hundred submissions of written evidence were received, and over ninety interviews were held. The records of the Committee were made available to researchers by the Trustees of both Trusts, and copies were deposited at both the British Library of Political and Economic Science (BLPES) in London and at Edinburgh University Library. The Committee on Voluntary Organisations ceased to exist after the report -The future of voluntary organisations- was published in 1978. Sir John Wolfenden (1906-1985), the Chair of the Committee, had also participated in the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution, 1954-1957."}

{"Labour movement activist William Paisley Earsman was born in Edinburgh on 16 March 1884. He was educated at a local council school in the St. Leonards area of city, and then completed an apprenticeship as a turner. He had also attended night classes at Heriot-Watt College where he was awarded a certificate in mechanical engineering. In 1908, he went to New Zealand and two years later went to Melbourne, Australia, working at the Camberwell Motor Works in 1910, with Victoria Railways until 1914, and then the Colonial Ammunition Company until 1917. While in Scotland, Earsman had become a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and in Australia he joined the Melbourne District branch. He was on the Committee of the District branch from March 1911, then Secretary in 1915-1916. A committed socialist and industrial unionist, Earsman was a member of the Victoria Socialist Party from 1911 to 1916, and was active in industrial disputes in 1917-1919. After the 1917 Revolution, he was in Russia. In 1917 too, he initiated the Victoria Labour College and was its Secretary until the middle of 1919. Earsman then went to Sydney and founded the New South Wales Labour College and acted as Secretary and Lecturer until April 1921. Earlier, he had been involved in the formation of the Communist Party of Australia and was elected Secretary on its foundation in Sydney on 30 October 1920. When the Party split in December he sought recognition for his 'Sussex Street' faction at the 3rd Congress of the Third Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow in April 1921. He was also at the Congress of the Red International of Labour Unions in July 1921. On his return to Australia in December 1921 he became mixed up in the rivalry between the two Communist Party factions in the country, but at the 4th Congress of Comintern in 1922 Earsman was successful in gaining recognition for the 'Sussex Street' faction. He became a member of the Comintern executive, met Leon Trotsky and Lenin, and was made an honorary member of the Red Army. When barred from Australia, he returned to Moscow - after a period in London and Edinburgh - and taught English at the Red Army Military Academy. When he returned to England, he worked in the testing of machine tools bound for the Soviet Union. In the late-1920s, Earsman left the Communist Party, and in 1932 he returned to Edinburgh, joining the Labour Party in 1934. Between 1934 and 1949 he was Secretary of the Edinburgh Trades Council, and in 1948 he was appointed President of the Scottish Council of the Labour Party. Not only was Earsman active in municipal affairs, he was a founder member of the Edinburgh Festival Society, 1947 to 1962, and he was awarded the OBE in 1950 for work in connection with the Festival.

{'George Low was born in Edzell, Angus, in 1747. He was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and then at St. Andrews University. In 1768, Low went to Stromness, Orkney, as a tutor. The rest of his life was taken up by the study of the natural history of the Orkney Islands, looking at birds, flora and fauna, and marine life there. As an aid to his studies of marine life, he constructed a microscope. In 1771, Low became licensed as a Minister by the Presbytery of Cairston, but he remained in Stromness for a couple more years after that. In the meantime, in 1772, after a visit to Iceland, the explorer and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820) visited Orkney in the company of the Swedish botanist Dr. Daniel Solander (1736-1782), and physician Dr. James Lind (1716-1794). Through them, Low was able to widen his correspondence and connections, and in 1774 began a tour of the south islands of Orkney and the whole of the Shetland Islands. Also in 1774, he was installed in the Parish of Birsay and Harray, and as Minister there, in relative seclusion, he was able to complete his works on the history and flora and fauna of Orkney. This was in addition to earlier work on the commerce, population, language, and archaeology of the islands. In 1778, Low toured the north islands of Orkney. Extensive use of the microscope during his research probably contributed to the onset of opthalmia and near complete blindness by 1793, thus cutting him off from his studies. George Low died in Orkney on 13 March 1795.'}

Between 1958 and 1964, he edited theBritish Journal of Psychology, and during this period the journal achieved an enhanced international position. Research on the assessment of personality dominated his later years, and this work had been grounded on his wartime experience in the Services. Influential titles were written on the subject, includingProjective techniques(1976). Earlier he had editedPersonality assessment: selected readings(1966). Throughout his career, Semeonoff did much to nurture the development of British psychology, and he was a member of the council of the British Psychology Society, a president of the Society, and honorary life member. His interest in sound was not only evident in his psychological research but also in music as a leisure activity. He wrote on this too, notablyRecord collecting: a guide for beginners(1949).

David Walsh. The Chairman of the first meeting was noted as George Combe and a moving spirit of the Society was Sir George Steuart Mackenzie of Coul, Baronet (1780-1848). The object of the Phrenological Society was 'to hear papers' and 'to discuss questions' connected with Phrenology. It would 'hold correspondence' with societies and individuals taking an interest in Phrenology, and collect and pursue facts and views that 'may improve and enlarge the boundaries of the Science'. Although Phrenology was a popular field of study well into the 20th century, it became discredited by scientific research. Phrenologists looked at the skull for indications of mental faculties and traits of character, and its principles were established by Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828), an Austrian, and by Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832) and George Combe. Gall had studied the heads of prisoners and inmates of lunatic asylums, and from his observations he deduced certain traits in the individuals, mapping out where 'murder' or 'theft' and so on were seated in the brain. Spurzheim and Combe went on to divide the scalp into regions where, for example, acquisitiveness, benevolence, combativeness, constructiveness, destructiveness, individuality, linguistic perception, self-esteem, wit and wonder etc were seated."}

{"Arthur Ruffell Barlow, Church of Scotland missionary and linguist, was born in Edinburgh in 1888. He was the nephew of David Clement Ruffell Scott, a Church of Scotland missionary in Malawi and Kenya. In 1903 at the age of seventeen Barlow joined his uncle at Scott's mission at Kikuyu, British East Africa (Kenya). He assisted with the mission's work in an unofficial capacity until 1908 when he was formally employed by the Church of Scotland. His interest in and grasp of the Kikuyu language and dialects meant he was often employed as a translator and his intimate knowledge of the Kikuyu people made him a trusted counsellor. He was a good friend of Jomo Kenyatta when both were young. In 1909 he became the first resident missionary at Tumutumu and acted, at various times, as superintendent at both Kikuyu and Tumutumu. He was one of the founders of the Kenya Missionary Council and acted as its secretary for a number of years as well as playing a prominent role in the debate on church and mission union in Kenya. Barlow's work with the Kikuyu language continued, he prepared a grammar which became a standard and initiated a bible translation. His knowledge of the language and culture and interest in questions such as land reform and the rights of Africans meant that he was also often consulted on African matters by government. After he retired on 30 June 1941 he continued his linguistic and translation studies, at first working for two years under an arrangement with the Church of Scotland. He publishedStudies in Kikuyu Grammar and Idiomin 1951 which followed an earlier 'tentative' work in 1946. He returned to Kenya from Scotland during the Mau Mau troubles and in 1953 took the role of Officer in Charge of the Translation Bureau of the African Information Services. He left Kenya for the final time in 1959. Barlow devoted a large amount of time in his later years to the production of a Kikuyu-English dictionary on which he worked with Canon Henry Leakey and Leonard Beecher, both of the Church Missionary Society. The dictionary was finally published in 1964 and Barlow died in 1965."}

In particular he organised the Ruskin Reading Guild and edited journals such as theRuskin Journal,World LiteratureandIgdrasil. He was also the founder and the first secretary of the Carlisle Society. He was ordained by the World Congregational Church in Dundee in 1890. In 1892 he was appointed a missionary at Calabar where he met Miss Elizabeth Hutton who had been a missionary there since 1891. In 1893 Marwick became ill and returned to Scotland to recover where he was joined by Miss Hutton. The two were married in December 1893 and returned to the mission in 1894 but his appointment was terminated in the same year for health reasons and they did not return to Calabar again until 1898. Marwick's interest in literature continued and in 1897 his bookWilliam and Louisa Anderson, A Record of their Life and Work in Jamaica and Old Calabarwas published. He also taught himself Efik and in 1899 he prepared a bilingual (Efik and Akunakuna) service book. The Marwicks travelled to Scotland on leave in 1900 expecting to return to Calabar but found that the Foreign Mission Committee of the United Free Church of Scotland wished to change the terms under which Marwick was employed. Marwick went instead as a missionary to Jamaica (1901-1910?) and was later a civil chaplain at Meerut, Northern India (1912-1915?). Marwick died in Edinburgh in 1940."}

{"Robert Moffat, Scottish missionary in South Africa, was born in 1795 at Ormiston, East Lothian. In 1813 he left home for High Leigh, near Liverpool where he worked as an under-gardener and where he became a Methodist. He was appointed as a missionary to South Africa by the London Missionary Society in 1816 and arrived at Cape Town in 1817. He spent his first year in Namaqualand where he converted the chief, Jager Afrikaner. In 1819 Moffat married Mary Smith who had come out from England to be with him and who was to play a vital role in his work. After some moves, caused by warfare amongst Zulu tribesmen, the Moffats opened a mission station in 1825 in Kuruman, south-east of the Kalahari, where they stayed for forty-nine years. The station became one of the foremost Protestant missionary communities in Africa and attracted many converts to the church. Moffat was known for his efforts to improve living standards in Africa by improving methods of agriculture and irrigation. He travelled widely, paying several visits to the Ndebele with whose chief he had become friendly. His last visit in 1859 resulted in the establishment of an London Missionary Society mission near Bulawayo, Matabeleland. Moffat became fluent in the Tswana (Setswana / Sechwana / Bechuana) language and in 1839 completed his translation of the New Testament. His translations became a standard and were of enormous importance to the growth of Christianity in Southern Africa. He also translatedPilgrim's Progress, compiled a Tswana hymn-book and in 1857 the whole bible was published in Tswana. He spent the years from 1839 to 1843 in England and in 1840 publishedMissionary Labourswhich went through four editions in three years. This and other works such asRivers of Water in a Dry Place(1863) made him the best known missionary in Britain. It was while he was in England that he met David Livingstone and secured him for the Bakwana mission. Livingstone married Moffat's daughter Mary in 1844. Failing health or, as Moffat himself put it, an 'over-taxed brain' compelled him 'to return to the land of his fathers' in 1870 and he settled in London. Moffat's wife died in 1871, but he remained active promoting foreign missions and raising funds for a seminary at Kuruman Station to train Africans for missionary work. Criticised by some as paternalistic and as lacking a deep understanding of African culture, Moffat was, nevertheless, one of the pioneers of the missionary movement in Southern Africa. He was made a D.D. of Edinburgh University in 1872 and died in 1883 in Leigh, Kent, England."}

{"David Clement Ruffell Scott, Church of Scotland missionary in Malawi and Kenya, was born in Edinburgh in 1853. He attended school in Edinburgh then spent some time working in an actuary's office before a calling to the church led him to study Arts and Divinity at the University of Edinburgh. He was a brilliant student graduating M.A. (1878) and B.D. (1881). Scott was ordained in 1881 and immediately sent to be head of the Church of Scotland mission at Blantyre in Nyasaland (now Malawi). He was responsible for virtually restarting the mission as all the previous staff had either resigned or been dismissed. Scott was a brilliant linguist, his interest in African culture and closeness to African people can be seen from hisCyclopaedic Dictionary of the Mang'anja Language(1892). Much of the periodicalLife and Work in Central Africabetween 1886 and 1898 was written by Scott. His efforts created a mission that was regarded as highly successful. Scott suffered a series of personal setbacks in 1895 with the deaths of his wife, brother-in-law and brother, and later of the daughter of his second wife. This, coupled with the Church of Scotland's decision to side with white settler critics, led him to resign in 1898. In 1901 Scott returned to Africa, to head the Kikuyu mission in British East Africa (Kenya) which had just been taken over by the Church of Scotland. However his work at Kikuyu was not as successful as his work at Blantyre. The death of his second wife in 1902, a series of illnesses, and criticism of his methods of running the mission marred the final years of his life. Despite this, his ability to relate to Africans remained unchanged and he attracted a number of outstanding Kikuyus to the mission. Scott died at Kikuyu on 13 October 1907."}

{"William Dick 1793-1866, was patron and first professor of the first veterinary school in Scotland: the Highland Society's Veterinary School. This was established in 1823. During his lifetime, William Dick was responsible for training approximately 1800 students. Over 800 of these sat the final certificate intending a career in veterinary medicine, the remainder attended lectures due to a professional interest. The school continues today as the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies which is the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Working as a blacksmith and farrier, alongside his father, William Dick observed the treatment of diseased animals from an early age. Whilst working for his father, he attended anatomy lectures at the University of Edinburgh with medical student friends. Encouraged by his lecturer, Dr. Barclay, Dick then attended the London Veterinary College. He applied for, and achieved his diploma within 3 months. On returning to Edinburgh he made various attempts to establish a veterinary school. Initially he supplied veterinary science lectures for an initiative by a Mr. Scott to set up an educational institution. After this project failed, Dick offered private lessons, until the founding of the School of Arts in 1821. This was a more successful venture, with 17 farriers attending his lecture series in the school's first year. In 1823 he was appointed lecturer in veterinary medicine for the Highland Society of Scotland. Practical classes were conducted at his father's farriery and his students were allowed to attend some medical classes at the University of Edinburgh. Dick financed the improvement of teaching facilities and until 1844 was the sole lecturer. Dick was a member of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh and on the editorial team ofThe Veterinarianfrom 1833-1845. He was closely involved with lobbying for the Royal Charter of Incorporation, 1844, which established the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons."}

{"John William Arthur, Church of Scotland medical missionary in East Africa, was born in Glasgow in 1881 the son of John W. Arthur, a Glasgow businessman. He was educated at Glasgow Academy and at Glasgow University from where he graduated M.B. Ch.B. in 1903 and took his M.D. in 1906. He was appointed to the post of medical missionary at the Kikuyu Mission, British East Africa (Kenya), in 1906, arriving at the mission on 1 January 1907. He opened the mission's first hospital and also became involved with its evangelical and educational work. Arthur succeeded Dr Henry E. Scott as head of the mission on the latter's death in 1911 and, after his ordination in 1915, he concentrated increasingly on ministerial rather than medical practice. He oversaw the mission during a period of notable growth, when he joined the mission staff there were no baptised Christians among the Kikuyu, by the time of his retirement the members of the Christian community numbered nearly 11,000. One of the many Africans influenced by Arthur and the mission was Jomo Kenyatta. During the First World War Arthur organised the Kikuyu Missions' Volunteer Carrier Corps for service in German East Africa and became the commanding officer. He was awarded the OBE in 1920 for his services. Arthur came to be accepted as one of the foremost spokesmen of missionary opinion in East Africa and worked enthusiastically for inter-mission co-operation. He also worked with the colonial government, applying pressure from within for reforms. He was a close advisor of J.H. Oldham and was involved in the conference in London in 1923 that declared the paramountcy of African interests in Kenya. He sat on various councils and served, from 1924-1926, as representative of African interests on the Legislative Council of Kenya and from 1928-1929 on the Kenyan Executive Council. Arthur was particularly concerned with problems of education, land ownership and labour reforms, and was involved in debates over the practice of female circumcision. From 1929 Arthur sought to strengthen the mission's resistance to the practice but his call for sanctions against Christians who practised it caused a Kikuyu reaction which adversely affected the membership of the church. Arthur resigned from the Legislative Council and his reputation as a voice of African interests was damaged. He retired in April 1937 and acted for a period as personal assistant at St Columba's (Church of Scotland), Pont Street, London. He then served as minister of Dunbog, Fife, a post which he held for around ten years. When he retired from Dunbog, Arthur took up residence in Edinburgh acting as locum tenes at the Tron Church for a year and spent the last year of his life as chaplain to the Astley-Ainslie Hospital. During his later years Arthur gave a number of interviews and papers on Kenya and East Africa, writing, for example,East Africa in Transitionin 1942. He returned to Kenya briefly in 1948 for the jubilee celebrations of the Church of Scotland mission. Arthur was a noted athlete and mountaineer. Whilst in Kenya he devoted most of his spare time to mountaineering and became president of the mountain club of East Africa. He married in 1921. He received an honorary degree of D.D. from the University of St Andrews in 1946. John William Arthur died in Edinburgh in 1952 at the age of 71."}

{"The French taxidermist Louis Dufresne was born in Champien, near Peronne in the Departement de la Somme, on 18 January 1752. He was the eldest in a large family and his parents found it difficult to support them. Dufresne was educated at the village school and from an early age he had developed an interest in natural history and began a collection of material that would continue over the next fifty years. Leaving Brest in August 1785, he set out with other naturalists aboard the vessel 'Astrolabe' on a natural history expedition. The 'Astrolabe' was accompanied by the the 'Boussole'. They visited Madeira, Tenerife, Trinidad, the coast of Brazil landing at Santa Catarina Island, Cape Horn landing at Concepcion Bay in Chile, the Sandwich Islands, and then to the coast of north-west America and to Alaska. In 1786, they resumed the expedition heading towards Monterey in California, and then across the Pacific to Macao in China. The expedition returned to France in 1787. In June 1793, Dufrsene joined the staff of the Department of Zoology at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and he stayed for the rest of his life. His work included not only taxidermy but also the classification of invertebrates and the arrangement of collections. He undertook various missions on behalf of the Museum, visiting many parts of the world. By 1818, the Dufresne Bird Collection had grown to some 1,600 specimens, perfectly stuffed and fixed on wooden supports with Latin and French names. The Dufresne Collection also included 800 exotic eggs as well as 4,000 shells, fossil shells, amphibious animals and corals, and 12,000 insects. In 1819, the Collection was purchased for the University of Edinburgh (and in 1866 it became part of the displays shown in the newly built museum which would later on become known as the Royal Scottish Museum). In 1829 Dufresne was awarded the Legion d'Honneur. Louis Dufresne died suddenly on 11 October 1832 after a fever resulting from inflammation of the lungs."}

{"Coltness is part of modern Wishaw in Stratchlyde Region, Scotland. The manuscripts in the Coltness Papers refer to the following notables and their transactions within the Scottish and British church, state and army: (1.) Sir James Steuart of Kirkfield and Coltness, born 1608, elected Lord Provost of Edinburgh 1648, and died 1681. (2.) His sons Sir Thomas Steuart of Coltness, born 1631 and died 1698; and, Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees, born 1635. Sir James was called to the bar on 20 November 1661. He published a political pamphlet in 1669 in defence of peoples' rights and had to flee the country, to Rouen. Later, after another difficulty, he fled again, this time to England. On his return, he had to flee yet again, this time to The Hague in 1681. He was later pardoned, and in 1692 he was appointed as Scotland's Lord Advocate. He resigned in 1709, and died in 1713. (3.) His son, Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees and Coltness, born 1681, became Scotland's Solicitor-General. He died in 1727. (4.) His son, Sir James Steuart Denham of Coltness and Westshield, who would later become a political economist, had been born on 21 October 1712. Sir James was educated in North Berwick and entered Edinburgh University in 1724-25 at the age of thirteen, studying law. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates on 25 January 1735. After that, there followed a period of travel which took him to Leyden, Avignon, and Rome where he was courted by the exiled Stewarts. Sir James returned to Scotland in 1740 and he was in Edinburgh when Prince Charles Edward Stewart occupied the city during the rebellion of 1745. Implicated in the rebellion, Sir James was obliged to leave Scotland for Germany after the Jacobite defeat at Culloden. While in Germany, he published works on political economy in Frankfurt-on-Main and in Tuebingen. He returned to Scotland in 1763 and continued his writing. Sir James died on 26 November 1780 and was buried at Cambusnethan, near Wishaw, Clydesdale. (5.) His son, the General, Sir James Steuart Denham, was born in August 1744. Because of his father's exile, Sir James had received his education in Germany. He entered the army in 1761 and travelled in France and Germany paying special attention to the armies of these countries. He received a troop of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers in 1766, and became a Major of the 13th Dragoons in 1772. By 1773 he was a Lieutenant-Colonel, and in 1782 was a Colonel. In 1784, Sir James became MP for the county of Lanark. He died in Cheltenham as the senior General of the army on 12 August 1839."}

{"The home ranch of the Swan Land and Cattle Company was sited at Chugwater, Wyoming. Its corporate headquarters were in Cheyenne. This large corporate cattle company, with between 50,000 and 80,000 livestock, at one time controlled an area of land greater than the size of the State of Connecticut. In the 1870s and 1880s, this and other very large ranches grew out of the realisation that cattle could be wintered on the northern plains of America. Speculative investors were promised a twenty per cent return from the new industry. In November 1882, Alexander Hamilton Swan (1831-1905), the President of the firms Swan and Frank Live-Stock Co., National Cattle Co., and Swan, Frank and Anthony Cattle Co., together with James Converse, Joseph Frank, and Godfrey Syndacker, entered into an agreement with James Wilson of Edinburgh to set up the Swan Land and Cattle Company as a British limited company. John Clay (1851-1934) followed Swan as general manager of the firm. By 1909, the company had reduced its dependence on cattle and had turned to the holding of sheep instead. In 1926, Swan Land and Cattle was re-organised in order to avoid British taxes and became an American corporation under the laws of Delaware. The corporation's assets were liquidated in 1948, and the last dividend was paid in 1951. Andrew Springs (Bud) Gillespie worked as a cowboy for Swan Land and Cattle Company during the 1900s, becoming a Wyoming rancher himself, performing in rodeos, and writing books about Wyoming history. Born on 23 August 1900 on the Flag Ranch, south of Laramie, Robert Homer Burns studied at the University of Wyoming from 1916-1920 and obtained his M.A. from Iowa State in 1921 and a Ph.D. in 1931 at Edinburgh University. He began teaching at the University of Wyoming in 1924, later serving as head of the Wool Department. From 1937-1939 Burns worked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and in 1946 he participated in a mission to China to study carpet-wool. In 1949, Burns then served as consultant to the Iranian government in New York. He published widely and his writing included material on Laramie ranches and the wider ranching industry, articles and data on Wyoming wool, wool shrinkage, pelt sizes in sheep, and breeds of sheep. Burns and Gillespie collaborated in the writing ofSteamboat. Symbol of Wyoming spirit(1952),Wyoming's pioneer ranches(1955) and some writing on the Swan Land and Cattle Company. Robert Homer Burns died in an automobile accident on 14 June 1973."}

{'Caen is a university city and commercial centre situated on the River Orne in the Calvados departement of northern France, in Normandy. It is a busy inland port, the river having been canalised (by Napoleon I) to the sea. The importance of Caen dates to the 11th century when it was a favourite residence of William I of England (William the Conqueror). An architectural gem, the city was largely demolished by Allied bombing and shelling during the Normandy Campaign of World War II. As an important port and road and rail centre, Caen had been vital to Allied success after D-Day. The plan had been for the British forces to seize the city in the first day or two after the landings and then to take the battle out into open countryside and towards the Seine. When this did not happen, it was necessary to keep the German forces committed to the city and to prevent them from switching attention to the all out defence of the port of Cherbourg which was essential to the Allies and which the American forces were to take. During the battle for Caen, the 14th century Church of St. Peter lost its famous spire, while the castle of William the Conqueror and the 17th century town hall were almost destroyed. However, three outstanding examples of 11th century Norman architecture were preserved, namely the Abbaye aux Hommes founded by William the Conqueror, who was buried there, and the Abbaye aux Dames founded by Queen Matilda, and the Church of St. Nicholas. The university which was founded in 1432 was destroyed, but has been rebuilt. An imposing memorial to the Battle of Normandy (1944) has been erected in the old rebuilt castle as a peace monument and museum.'}

{"The ornamental turner Charles Holtzapffel was born in 1806. He was the son of the German engineer John Jacob Holtzapffel (1768-1835), from Alsace, who had settled in London in the 1780s and who had founded the tool business in the 1790s. Trading as John Holtzapffel in London's Long Acre, the firm was noted for its production of iron-bedded lathes with ornamental turning apparatus. In 1804 the firm was expanded to include John George Deyerlein but this arrangement lasted only until 1827. In 1827, Charles Holtzapffel joined the firm at the age of 21. The younger Holtzapffel had received a good English education, and through careful training in the firm's workshop he had become a skilled engineer in his own right. On the death of his father, Charles carried on the firm and continued to develop the machinery and attachments for ornamental turnery. Other devices were invented too, including machinery for printing banknotes, a dividing engine for the graduation of drawing scales, and an apparatus for tracing geometrical figures on glass. In 1838, Charles published hisNew system of scales of equal parts applicable to various purposes of engineering, architecture and general sciencefollowed by its complement, theList of scales of equal parts. In 1843, he publishedTurning and mechanical manipulation. Volume 1: Materials, their choice, preparation and various modes of working them. This was actually his father's work and was followed in 1846 by his ownTurning and mechanical manipulation. Volume 2: Construction, action, and application of cutting tools. By 1884, five volumes of this turner's bible had been published by Charles and his son John Jacob Holtzapffel II. Charles Holtzapffel was a member of the Council of the Institute of Civil Engineers, and was Chairman of the Mechanic's Committee of the Society of Arts. He died on 11 April 1847 and his widow Amelia Vaux (Dutton) Holtzapffel managed the firm until 1853. Their son John Jacob became head of the firm in 1867 and managed the business until 1896 when Charles' nephew George William Budd (later known as George William Holtzapffel) took over. John Jacob Holtzapffel II died in Eastbourne on 14 October 1897. In 1919, Colonel John George Holtzapffel Budd, the son of George William Holtzapffel, began to take an active part in running the firm."}

{"The Canadian Pacific Railway Company entered the ship-owning business in 1884 with three steamers which were built to operate Great Lakes services. In 1887 a service between Vancouver and the Orient was begun with chartered vessels, to be followed in 1891 by the company's own 'Empress' ships - the 'Empress of China', the 'Empress of India' and the 'Empress of Japan'. Then, in 1890, passenger routes were established between Toronto, Montreal and Chicago. Transatlantic passenger services commenced in 1903 when the fleet was augmented by the acquisition of the North Atlantic interests of Elder Dempster & Company. The Company's 'Empress of Britain' (the first of that name) and 'Empress of Ireland' came into service in 1906. The 'Empress of Asia' and the 'Empress of Russia' followed in 1913, the 'Empress of France' in 1919, and the 'Empress of Scotland' in 1921. In 1921 too the title of the operating company became Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd. On the outbreak of war in 1939, Canadian Pacific placed all their ships at the disposal of the government and several were taken over as troopships. For the company, Atlantic passenger carrying would last barely four decades. In the 1960s when air travel and cargo containerisation started to compete with North Atlantic shipping companies, the passenger ships were gradually sold and new container and bulk cargo vessels built. The firm moved with the times. The more modern 'Empress of Britain' was the third Canadian Pacific ship of that name. The first had been renamed the 'Montroyal' in 1924 and was scrapped in 1930, and the second which came into service in 1931 had been requisitioned as a troopship in 1939. This one was bombed, torpedoed and sunk in the North Atlantic in 1940. The newer ship was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow and was the sister ship of the 'Empress of England' which came into service a year after the 'Empress of Britain'. The 25,526 ton ship was launched by the Queen in 1955 and was said to be the first of the North Atlantic liners to be completely air-conditioned. The ship's maiden voyage began on 20 April 1956 from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal, the company's summer route. The 'Empress of Britain' served only seven years on the route and its final Liverpool trip began on 3 September 1963. It was then chartered for cruising and was sold in November 1964 to a Greek company. Renamed the 'Queen Anna Maria' it sailed from Piraeus to New York and later on from Haifa to New York. In 1975 the ship was sold to Carnival Cruise Lines and was renamed 'Carnivale'. Its name changed again in 1993 to the 'Fiesta Marina'. In April 2000 the ship was still in service, this time with the Greek firm Epirotiki Cruises and called the 'Olympic'."}

{"John Smith Flett was born in Kirkwall, Orkney, on 26 June 1869. He was educated at Kirkwall Burgh School and at George Watson's College, Edinburgh. In 1886 he entered Edinburgh University studying Arts, Science, and Medicine, and was awarded the degree of M.A. at the age of nineteen, the degree of B.Sc. in 1892, and the degrees of M.B. and C.M. (Master in Surgery) in 1894. A brief spell in medical practice followed, before he joined the staff of the Geology Department of Edinburgh University as Assistant to Professor James Geikie (1839-1915), and then as a Lecturer in Petrology. Flett's earliest noteworthy research was his investigations into the stratigraphy of the Old Red Sandstone of Orkney and into the petrography of the alkaline dykes found in that formation. For this Orkney research he was awarded the degree of D.Sc. from Edinburgh University in 1900, and that year too he became Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1901, Flett took up the post of Petrographer to the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and acquired a comprehensive knowledge of British rocks. Whilst in post, he collaborated with Dr. Tempest Anderson (1846-1913) in studying the vulcanicity of the Soufriere and Mont Pelee in the West Indies. In 1911 he became Assistant to the Director of the Geological Survey of Scotland, and during the First World War he was responsible for the supply of geological information required. In 1918, Flett was appointed OBE and was awarded the KBE in 1925. Towards the end of his career, Flett was responsible for the transfer of the Geological Survey to the Geological Museum at South Kensington, in 1935. His published works include a collaborative piece,James Geikie: the man and the geologist(1917) as well asThe first hundred years of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, 1835-1935(1937).

{"James Orchard Halliwell was born in Sloane Street, in London's Chelsea, on 21 June 1820. He was educated at private schools, and showed an aptitude for mathematics. In his teen years, he began to collect books and manuscripts. In November 1837 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, but in April 1838 he transferred to Jesus College. There, he was awarded a mathematical prize and scholarship, and he acted as Librarian. In 1839, before he was nineteen years of age, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and then Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1840, Halliwell left Cambridge after the Lent term, without a degree, and settled in London. By then, he had collected around 130 early manuscripts, mainly dealing with mathematics and astrology, but these had to be sold under pressure from creditors. In London he worked in the Library of the British Museum and continued buying books and manuscripts. It was his purchase and collection of manuscripts that, in 1844, led to serious charges against him of abstracting material from Trinity College. Throughout his life, he was an insatiable collector of rare books and manuscripts. Halliwell was also an energetic member of the many literary societies founded at the time - the Camden Society, the Percy Society, the Shakespeare Society. To the latter he contributed many short essays. In 1841, Halliwell came to the attention of antiquary and bibliophile Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792-1872). He soon became a house guest and in 1842 Halliwell married the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Phillipps, after which he assumed the name of James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps. Also at this time, he began to concentrate his attention on the life of Shakespeare and the text of Shakespeare's works. His publication record as a whole includes works on archaeology, folklore, balladry, philology, and history, and some notable works areA brief account of the life, writings and inventions of Sir Samuel Morland: master of mechanics to Charles the Second(1838),An introduction to the Midsummer Night's Dream, an essay on the character of Falstaff and Shakesperiana(1841),Dictionary of archaic and provincial words, obsolete phrases, proverbs, and ancient customs from the fourteenth century(1846),New boke about Shakespeare and Stratford-upon-Avon(1850),The complete works of Shakspere: revised from the original editions(1850), andOutlines of a life of Shakespeare(1881). In the course of his literary researches he often had occasion to communicate with David Laing (1793-1878), historian, antiquary, bibliographer, and collector. James O.

{"The poet Helen Burness Cruickshank was born near Hillside, Montrose, in Angus, on 15 May 1886. She was educated at the local Hillside Public School and at Montrose Academy. In 1903, she joined the Post Office as a civil servant in London. There she became involved with the Suffragette movement and in particular with the Woman Clerks' Association which campaigned for better pay for women. In 1912, Cruickshank returned to Edinburgh, working in the newly established National Health Insurance Scheme. In Edinburgh she made contact with Christopher Murray Grieve (1892-1978), otherwise known as Hugh MacDiarmid, and William Soutar (1898-1943), among many other writers and artists. She became involved with Scottish PEN (an association of poets, playwrights, editors, essayists and novelists) founded by Grieve. Cruickshank's poems are rich in the sights and sounds of 20th century Scotland and contain sharp political perception of the position both of women and of Scotland. On the death of her father in 1924, she looked after and then nursed her aged mother for many years and some of her poetry confronts the sadness of lifelong virginity and childlessness. At a graduation ceremonial on 2 July 1970, Cruickshank was awarded the honorary degree of M.A. from Edinburgh University for her services to literature. Helen Burness Cruickshank suffered a slight stroke in 1973 and in 1974 she entered Queensberry Lodge, Edinburgh, where care and emergency help was on hand. She died there on 2 March 1975."}

{'James Hutton was most well known for achievements in geology. He was born in Edinburgh on 3 June 1726. He was educated at the city\'s Royal High School and he studied at Edinburgh University first matriculating there in 1740. His most important contribution to science was theTheory of the Earth(1785) which earned him the accolade of \'founder of modern geology\'. In his work, he noted: "with respect to Human observation, this world has neither a beginning nor an end" - a principle now accepted as axiomatic. Hutton also had interests in the physical sciences, in particular, chemistry, physics and meteorology. Toward the end of his life he published a three-part book entitledDissertations on Different Subjects in Natural Philosophy(1792) where he discussed mostly meteorology, phlogiston, and the theory of matter. Hutton also engaged in more philosophical concerns of the time. He published a three volume treatise on metaphysics and moral philosophy entitledAn Investigation of the Principles of Knowledge and of the Progress of Reason, From Sense to Science and Philosophy( 1794). James Hutton died on 26 March 1797. On his death, Hutton\'s sister Isabella gave his collection of fossils to Dr. Joseph Black (1728-1799), Professor of Chemistry at Edinburgh University, and he in turn presented them to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Trace of the fossil collection was then lost, and this became a research interest of Rolland J. B. Munro working in the 1930s and 1940s.'}

{"The Outlook Tower is situated on Edinburgh's Castlehill (Castle Hill), high on a ridge between Lawnmarket and the Castle Esplanade, at the top of the Royal Mile in the Old Town. The building was formerly a town mansion, with its bottom storeys dating from the 17th century and its castellated upper storeys being added in 1853 when it was reconstructed as Short's Observatory - probably by David Rhind (1801-1883). From that date, it housed a Camera Obscura on the uppermost level. In 1892, the Outlook Tower was acquired on a lease by Sir Patrick Geddes (1854-1932) who had become involved in the renewal of the city's Old Town. In 1896, the Tower was purchased by the Town and Gown Association, a body formed to assist with the financial challenges met in the renewal of the Old Town. The Tower was to be developed as a regional and sociological laboratory; a centre for post-graduate studies, experimental education and civic improvement. Geddes intended that the building should offer an interactive experience and that it be a civic museum and educational resource. Summer Schools and meetings were organised on such varied subjects as seaside and garden biology, the theory of evolution, philosophy and art. The social phenomena of the city were also observed. The Outlook Tower acted as a centre for teaching, reference and study around all of these activities, and became a civic and urban observatory or laboratory. Geddes believed that such a centre for 'civic and social outlook' could be 'experimented with in any city' and better still with 'the co-operative activity of a Current Events Club'. Today, the Outlook Tower still houses a Camera Obscura and it is a popular tourist attraction."}

She was educated at Edinburgh Ladies College in Queen Street before completing Medical Studies at Edinburgh Medical College and then graduating MB ChB from the University in 1908. She spent early career years in India as a missionary, where she married, and then in 1929 she became a candidate for training at the Tavistock Clinic in London. In 1931, she and her husband came to Edinburgh, he to become Registrar and Secretary of the Edinburgh College of Art, and she to establish a clinic along the lines of the Tavistock. By 1939 she had gathered the helpers required, among them the Rev. Hogg, his Session Clerk, and the all important premises - within the Davidson Church. Soon the Davidson Clinic had its own premises nearby in Fettes Row, Edinburgh The aims and objectives of the Davidson Clinic were similar to those of the Tavistock Clinic, namely therapeutic approaches in mental health. The Clinic spawned the Davidson Family Clinic and its work grew, requiring new and larger premises. The move to Chalmers Street made it possible to open an Occupational Therapy Department, and a hostel for mentally handicapped children was organised in Lauriston Gardens. In 1951 the Clinic moved to still larger premises in Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh, and a daughter clinic was opened in Glasgow in 1952. In 1967, the Clinic in Edinburgh moved again, this time to Hartington Place. Dr Winifred Rushforth retired in August 1967 and she received the OBE in 1968. She had always tried to help people achieve their true potential and to develop their true selves and amongst many who were deeply inspired by her insights was Charles, Prince of Wales who - at the suggestion of Sir Laurens van der Post - made a private visit to her.

The name in its original form referred to either a chamber attendant, or to the Treasury chamber (camera), and thus to Chamberlain. When the Old French word was naturalized in Scots it lost the 'b' by elision, and received 'l' to safeguard as it were, the length of the preceding vowel, as shown in the pronunciation 'chaamer' or 'chammer'. Among the earliest Chalmers in Scotland were Hugh de Camera ('of the chamber') who was a witness to a charter of David I (1124 - 1153) and to charters of Malcolm IV (1153 - 1156), and Hebertus de Camera whose family held lands in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire. The latter was 'camerarius regis scotiae' or Great Chamberlain of Scotland from 1124 to 1153. He and his brothe Radalfus were witnesses to charters of King William the Lion (1165 - 1214). In the instrument of homage extracted from all substantial Scottish landowners by Edward I of England during his military campaign of 1296 (his 'Ragman Roll'), several Chalmers (or de la Chaumbre) appear in the list of around two thousand names of barons, landowners, burgesses and clergy. They include Robert de la Chaumbre and William de la Chaumbre of Lanarkshire. There is also a William de la Chaumbre, baillie and burgess of Peebles, and a Symon and William of Dumfriesshire and Wautier of Berwickshire In 1322 King Robert I (Robert the Bruce) - also of French lineage (de Brus) - granted a charter of the lands of Moubreis or Wardland in the sherriffdom of Banff to Gilbert Chalmer, and in that same year Roger Chalmer received a charter of the half of the fourth part of the west part of Fintray in the sheriffdom of Aberdeen. King Robert also gave Reginald Chalmer of Galdgirth a charter under the great seal of his own estate of Galdgirth in Ayrshire. Later on, in Ayrshire, James Chalmer of Gadgirth was an active supporter of John Knox and entertained him at the family seat of Gadgirth. Probably the most famous Chalmers is the Rev. Dr. Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847), first moderator of the Free Church of Scotland. He was born in Fife and was a descendant of John Chalmers of Pitmedden, whose branch is believed to be connected to the Ayrshire (Gadgirth or Galdgirth) family. The name today, although perhaps not common, is widespread, not only in Scotland, but also all over the world - particularly the English speaking world. In England the equivalent name is Chambers or Chamberlain."}

{"Christian Science was founded in 1879 in the USA by Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910). Chronic ill-health led her to the charismatic healer Phineas P. Quimby. His suggestive therapeutics led her to believe in the mental nature of her illness. In 1866 she recovered from the effects of an accident while reading about the healings of Jesus in the New Testament. This prompted a period in her life of intense scriptural study and writing, and in 1870 she began teaching and attracting a following in Massachussetts. In 1875 she publishedScience and healthwhich became the textbook for the study and practice of Christian Science. In 1879, she and a group of followers founded the Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, and she instructed at the Massachussetts Metaphysical College chartered by her in 1881. By the end of the 1880s some one hundred congregations had been formed, mostly in the Atlantic states and the Midwest. By 1910 there were more than 1,200. The government of the church was set down in Eddy'sManual of the mother churchin 1895.

In 1854 it was made compulsory, although it was not properly enforced until the 1874 Vaccination Act which made registration of births compulsory within 6 weeks, something which occurred in Scotland from 1855.In 1896, parents in England and Wales were permitted to register their conscientious objection to compulsory smallpox vaccination by making a statutory declaration and registering this with the local registrar of births marriages and deaths.

{"The Edinburgh suburb of Clermiston which lies to the west of Corstorphine Hill and the city's Zoological Gardens was originally the Clermiston Estate. Earliest mention of the land is recorded circa 1250 in theDunfermline register. In these earlier days it was referred to variously as Clerbaudiston and terram de Clerribaldi and Clerembald's toun. By 1754, the estate had been subdivided into North Clermiston and South Clermiston, and Clermiston House had been built in 1792. North Clermiston was also referred to as Nether Clermiston, and South Clermiston has been referred to as Mid Clermiston, and later Clermiston Mains. In 1774, Sir Walter Scott's father had raised a loan on security of part of the Clermiston Estate. As the city expanded in all directions into the near countryside in the 19th and early 20th centuries, references to Clermiston were drawn into city street names in the area: Clermiston Terrace by 1912, Clermiston Avenue by 1937, and Clermiston Crescent, Drive, Gardens, Green, Grove, Hill, Loan, Medway, Park, Place and View by 1953. The Clermiston Mains area together with part of Cramond Muir began to be developed for housing in 1957 and street names there were borrowed fromKidnappedby Robert Louis Stevenson."}

{"Principal of Edinburgh University and historian, Sir William Robertson, was born on 19 September 1721 at the manse in Borthwick, Midlothian, where his father was minister. He received his early education at the parish school in Borthwick and then at the Burgh School in Dalkeith. In the autumn of 1733, Robertson entered the University of Edinburgh studying Arts and Divinity. After completion of his studies and earning his license to preach, he became minister of Gladsmuir in East Lothian in 1743. With the approach to Edinburgh of the Jacobite army in 1745, Robertson left his manse to offer his services, with some others, to Sir John Cope against the Rebellion. However, Cope declined to admit them. In 1746, Robertson was elected as member to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. This indicated steady advancement in his career. In 1753 he began work on a long writing project on the history of Scotland which culminated in hisHistory of Scotland(1759). The work was a great success and shortly before its publication he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Edinburgh University. Shortly after publication of his work he was successively appointed Chaplain of Stirling Castle and Chaplain Royal in 1759, elected joint-minister of Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh in 1761, became Principal of the University in 1762, and in 1764 was appointed Historiographer Royal for Scotland. His next literary work was theHistory of Charles V(1769) which enhanced his reputation in Europe and earned him praise from Voltaire and the Empress Catherine of Russia. His last great work was theHistory of America(1777). His life was also filled by his work with the affairs of the General Assembly and with those of Edinburgh University. The initiative to rebuild the University - Old College - owed its origins to the influence of Robertson. He had launched a public appeal which won the support of successive Town Councils and Lords Provost, and he managed to secure the services of the architect Robert Adam. In 1791, Robertson's health began to decline and he died of jaundice on 11 June 1793"}

{"Edmonstone is south east of Edinburgh, adjacent to Little France and to Craigmillar, historically in the parish of Newton in Midlothian. Its name derives from Edmund's tun, or farm. The estate belonged to the Edmonstone family from 1248 until the early 17th century. It briefly belonged to the Rait family before passing to John Wauchope (1633-1709) in 1671, through marriage. Wauchope was related to the Wauchopes of Niddrie Merschell. In 1672 he became Lord of Session and assumed the title Lord Edmonstone. Like the estates of neighbouring Niddry and Duddingston, there had been coal on the Edmonstone estate. In the 1940s the roof of Edmonstone House was removed by surviving family in an effort to escape taxation and it subsequently fell into decay. Today, Edmonstone is part of suburban and built-up Edinburgh and close to the outer ring road."}

{"The Liberal Party in Britain was formed on 6 June 1859 from a gradual amalgamation of Whigs, Radicals and Peelites, and for much of the following thirty years the Liberals governed the country. William Gladstone (1809-1898), Liberal leader and four times Prime Minister, dominated British politics during that period. The question of Home Rule for Ireland weakened the Liberal Party however and from 1886 it stayed out of power for the next twenty years. The weak leadership of Lord Rosebery (1847-1929), Gladstone's successor, and the continuing squabbles in the party over Ireland kept it in the doldrums into the opening years of the twentieth century. A landslide victory in 1906 brought the Liberals back to power, partly as a result of an electoral pact with the new-born Labour Party which helped the latter to take a number of Conservative seats in north-west England. Under the Prime Ministers Henry Campbell-Bannerman (1836-1908) and Herbert Asquith (1852-1928), the Liberal governments from 1906 to 1915 broke the power of the House of Lords and laid the foundations of the modern welfare state, introducing old age pensions and the national insurance system. However, industrial unrest, the issue of votes for women, Ireland, factionalism within the party, and the demands of the First World War demoralised the Liberals between 1910 and 1915, and Asquith acceded to a coalition government led by the Conservatives. In 1918, David Lloyd George (1863-1945) emerged as the leader of the Liberals in the coalition, but when the Conservatives brought the coalition to an end in 1922 the Liberal Party began to find itself in the wilderness during a period of electoral instability. Indeed, in 1922 it was the Labour Party that emerged as the second largest party in the House of Commons and this was confirmed again in elections in 1923. From now on British politics would become polarised into the 'left' and the 'right' with support for the Conservatives and Labour centred on heartland areas, and the Liberal Party began to find itself on the fringes of politics. In 1924 the Liberals lost 75 per cent of its parliamentary representation and by 1935 it had only 21 MPs. In 1945 this was reduced to only 12, all in rural seats, half of which were in Wales. In 1957, the Liberals had only 5 MPs and were close to extinction. At this low point, Megan Lloyd George (1902-1966), daughter of David Lloyd George, won the Carmarthen seat for the Labour Party. A new dawn was to come however. In 1956, Liberal leader Clement Davies (1884-1962) retired and he was replaced by Jo Grimond (1913-1993), MP for Orkney and Shetland. Grimond was younger, an excellent communicator, and provided a sharper edge to party policy, and the Liberals as a party seemed suddenly in tune, young and fresh. They supported British membership of the Common Market (later the EEC, the EC, then EU) and they opposed the nuclear deterrent. Most importantly they recognised the importance of by-elections, but in spite of one or two spectacular by-election wins - one of which was Orpington in 1962 - little progress was made in general elections. Grimond retired in 1967 to be replaced by Jeremy Thorpe (b. 1929). The 1970 election again saw the party reduced to only 6 seats, but in 1974 this increased to 14 . Then, in 1976, Thorpe resigned over allegations about his private life and he was replaced by David Steel (b. 1938). He immediately led the Liberals into a pact with the Labour Party which had lost its Commons majority. The Lib-Lab Pact was ended in 1978, and in the 1979 election the Conservatives and Margaret Thatcher were swept into power. While the Labour Party was wracked in a struggle with the 'left', many of its moderates jumped from the party along with Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers - the Gang of Four - and they formed the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. Later that year, the Liberals formed an alliance with the SDP. In 1982, Roy Jenkins (1920-2003) was elected SDP leader. The new party and the Liberals won a string of by-elections and in the 1983 election the Alliance parties won 25.4 per cent of the vote. This however brought only 23 seats. Jenkins resigned as leader and was replaced by David Owen (b. 1938). Throughout the mid-1980s the Alliance gained further by-election wins but tensions between the two parties began to emerge, so when the Alliance share of the 1987 election vote fell 22.6 per cent, Steel proposed a merger of the two parties. Owen was opposed to this. Merger of the SDP and the Liberals was approved by a majority of both parties nevertheless and the new party came into being on 3 March 1988 and Paddy Ashdown was elected its leader in July 1988. Initially there was confusion as to the name of the new party - known in the beginning as the Social and Liberal Democrats - but the name Liberal Democrats gradually took hold. A low point for the new party as it tried to establish its place in British politics was the 1989 European Parliament elections when it was beaten to fourth place by the Greens. By 1990 however, the Liberal Democrats were winning by-elections and in 1992 they had secured themselves as the third force in British politics, and in the 1997 general election they won 16.8 per cent of the vote and 46 seats in the Commons. The 2001 election brought them 52 seats. In Scotland where the Liberal Democrats compete with the Labour Party, the SNP and the Conservatives, the party managed to win 10 seats in 2001. One of the Labour Party wins in Scotland was the constituency of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley formerly known as South Ayrshire. Within this constituency there is a small Conservative vote centred on the coast, in the smaller towns such as Girvan, and in the farmland inland, but the seat is dominated by the former mining communities of New Cumnock and Dalmellington, once the heart of the South Ayrshire coalfield. In the 2001 election, the Liberal Democrats took a share of only 7.3 per cent of the vote in Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. Thirty years earlier in 1970 there had been no room for the Liberals at all in South Ayrshire. With a share of 61 per cent, Jim Sillars (Labour Party, then later of the Scottish Labour Party, then the SNP) saw off the Conservatives with a 31 per cent majority. The SNP won just over 8 per cent. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the southern part of Ayrshire would have been fertile ground for the old Liberal Party."}

{"Colin Cameron was born in Lanark on 24 August 1933. He was educated at Uddingston Grammar School and then studied Law at Glasgow University graduating in May 1957 with the degree of Bachelor of Law. While at University he represented the Law Faculty on the Students' Representative Council. He was resident in Uddingston, Glasgow, when his application for entry as an immigrant to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was approved in June 1957. In Nyasaland (now Malawi), Cameron took up an appointment as a Solicitor with Messrs Wilson and Morgan, Legal Practitioners, Blantyre, a law concern strongly connected to the United Federal Party - the party of Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, 1956-63. During a state of emergency in 1959, Cameron gave legal help to Africans who had been arrested and detained, and this led to objections from his employers and to ostracism by the white community. Cameron was a paid-up member of the African National Congress. In 1959, he also became a member of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian and three of his children were baptised into the local church. On the expiry of his contract, he returned to Scotland in late 1960, but at the request of Dr. Hastings K. Banda he returned to Africa to stand in the 1961 General Election against the United Federal Party. In this Election for the Nyasaland Legislative Council held on 15 August 1961, Cameron, then aged 27, campaigned as an independent candidate in the Soche Constituency, receiving support in his campaign from the Malawi Congress Party headed by Banda. Cameron voiced his sympathy with the African Nationalist movement and expressly denounced apartheid. He indicated too that he was against the federal structure in Central Africa at that time. A daring challenge to Welensky to debate election issues with him met with the answer that the Prime Minister was fully committed. Cameron was elected to the Council along with the first Africans elected to government in Malawi, and in September 1961, he became Minister of Works and Transport with responsibility for Works, Transport, Water Supply and Sewerage across the country. Thereafter he was Minister of Transport and Communications with the responsibility of transferring the federal functions of Road, Rail, Air, and the Post Office back to the Malawi Government. The Central African Federation to which Cameron indicated his opposition was dissolved in 1963. In August 1964, Cameron resigned from the Cabinet on the issue of the introduction by Banda of an amendment to the Constitution allowing detention without trial as part of the law of the newly independent Malawi. On the resumption of private legal practice in Blantyre he represented the former Minister of Education, Henry Chipembere, in a constitutional case which challenged Banda in the High Court, but this resulted in him having to leave Malawi with his family on forty-eight hours notice. During the next thirty years, Cameron established his own legal practice in Irvine, Scotland, and although unable to return to Malawi he continued to support and take an active interest in refugees from Malawi who were then living in Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom. After the first multi-party elections in Malawi in May 1994, Cameron and his wife were invited back to the country and he was offered the position of Honorary Consul for the Republic of Malawi in Scotland by the new President of the country, Bakili Muluzi. Colin Cameron was, for six years, a member of the Council of the Law Society of Scotland, is an active member of Amnesty International, and is an active member of the Scottish National Party."}

{'The industrial chemist and academic geologist Professor Sir Frederick Henry Stewart was born on 16 January 1916. He was educated at Fettes College, Edinburgh, and he studied at Aberdeen University and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In 1941 he joined the Research Dept. of ICI (Billingham Division) as a mineralogist, and in 1943 he became a Lecturer in Geology at Durham University. In 1956, Stewart was appointed to the Regius Chair of Geology and Mineralogy at Edinburgh University where he set about building up the Grant Institute of Geology. Under his tenure the Institute tripled in size and by the mid-1960s was receiving funding sufficient to build and equip an experimental laboratory unit which was later chosen by NASA for the analysis of lunar samples under vacuum to simulate the conditions of the lunar surface. He became Dean of the Faculty of Science in 1965 and a member of the Council for Scientific Policy in 1967. Professor Stewart was knighted in 1974. He served as a Trustee of the British Museum (Natural History) from 1983-1987. In addition to papers on igneous and metamorphic petrology and salt deposits, his published works includeThe British caledonides, edited with R. W. Johnson (1963), andMarine evaporates(1963). After his retiral, he founded the Mull Expeditionary Sapphire Society (MESS) in 1982, and he discovered the largest sapphire ever found in Scotland. Professor Sir Frederick Henry Stewart died in Oban on 9 December 2001. His widow is the accomplished writer, Mary Stewart (b. 1916).'}

The documents here outline the nature of this incident and explain how it was resolved.", 'The Event Database was used to help link artists wishing to take part with venues wishing to stage an event.', "Scotland Africa '97 (SA '97) was an umbrella organisation which aimed at the strengthening of existing links between Scotland and Africa and the creation of new routes to understanding and co-operation. Between May and October 1997, a series of cultural events took place with these aims in mind, under the bannerScotland Africa '97. Because of the positive feedback and the success of the events generally, it was decided to set up an archive serving as a record of the events held. It was hoped that the archive could be used as a source for researchers examining the impact of SA '97 and as a resource for anyone looking for information about the organisations involved. The idea for the series of cultural events came from the Centre of African Studies at Edinburgh University. It was intended that the events should raise the profile of Africa and explore the historical and contemporary links between Scotland and the huge continent. The events held were both large and small, and although many were held in Edinburgh, SA '97 offices had been established in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen to support the events of organisations all over the country, from Dundee and Musselburgh, to Argyll and Inverness, and from Kelso and Dumfries, to Banchory and Stromness. The events ranged from an African ceramics exhibition, fashion show, and African storytime for children, to a rhino awareness week, a play about Mungo Park, and an exhibition on Mary Slessor.", 'Evening hosted by: Professor Alexander McCall Smith, Faculty of Law Edinburgh, University of Edinburgh, Old College Edinburgh.', 'Also shown at Inverness Museum & Art Gallery.', 'Also shown at Edinburgh College of Art.'}

{"George Goudie Chisolm was born in Edinburgh on 1 May 1850. He was educated at the city's Royal High School, and studied at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated MA in 1870. He had a gift for languages and was able to function in Latin, Greek, French, German and Italian. He started out on a literary career working in the editorial department of publishers W.G. Blackie & Son (Glasgow). Chisolm left for London in 1881, and apart from taking the degree of B.Sc. in Natural Sciences in Edinburgh in 1883, London was to be his home until 1908. Specialising in Geography, he became a University Extension Lecturer, and established for himself a solid reputation in the subject. With the setting up of a Lectureship in Geography at Edinburgh University in 1908, Chisolm was the obvious choice. He became Reader in 1921. His first geographical work was The two hemispheres (1882). Around the same time, the Royal Geographical Society had come to realise that Geography was badly neglected in Britain in comparison to European countries, both in the universities and in schools. Chisolm however was already prepared for the task of advancing the status of the subject. A series of school geographies was prepared, and a school atlas. Other more ambitious works were Handbook of commercial geography (1889), andGazetteer of the world(1895) which later became known as The Times gazetteer. Chisolm retired from Edinburgh University in 1923. He had long been the Secretary of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. George Goudie Chisolm died in Edinburgh on 9 February 1930."}

{"Although the Copperbelt of Zambia (formerly Northern Rhodesia) is situated in the very heart of Africa and some 1,500 miles from the coast by rail, and another 6,000 miles from the port of Beira in Mozambique to European markets, the percentage of copper mineralisation in the ore from Zambia made exploitation worthwhile. According to Francis L. Coleman, the world average of copper mineralisation in ore in the 1960s and 1970s was 1.5 percent, and deposits of as low as 0.7 percent could be profitable depending on location etc. In fact the Copperbelt ore averaged around 3.5 percent copper.

{"The phonetician Professor David Abercrombie, son of poet Lascelles Abercrombie, was born 19 December 1909. He can be considered as one of the great phoneticians in the history of the discipline. Abercrombie was educated at Leeds Grammar School, Leeds University, University College London, and the Sorbonne. His first academic appointment as Assistant Lecturer in English at the London School of Economics (LSE) was in 1934. He returned there after the war, between 1945 and 1947. During the war, he worked in Athens, Cyprus, and Cairo. After the LSE, he lectured in phonetics at Leeds University. In 1948 however, he joined Edinburgh University and spent 32 years there, as Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader, Professor of Phonetics (1964-80), and Emeritus (1980-92).

{'The American statesman, philosopher, printer, scientist, and writer Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston, USA, on 17 January 1706. Franklin was the only American of the colonial period to earn a European reputation as a natural philosopher, but he is best remembered in the United States as a patriot and diplomat. As a boy he worked as a printer for his father then brother, but went to Philadelphia to work in 1723. He visited London between 1724 and 1726 and then returned to Philadelphia in 1729. He became the owner and editor of thePhiladelphia Gazette. He also sold books, established a circulating library, and set up a debating club that became the American Philosophical Society. In 1751, he also helped to establish an academy that eventually became the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin also extended his own knowledge by the study of foreign languages, philosophy, and science. He repeated the experiments of other scientists and invented the Franklin stove, bifocal eyeglasses, and a glass harmonica. Electricity interested him too, and in 1748 he turned his printing business over to his foreman, so that he could devote his life to science. He arranged a famous experiment of flying a kite in a thunderstorm, which proved that lightning is an electrical discharge. He went on to invent the lightning rod. As a scientist he won recognition from the leading scientists in England and on the Continent. Franklin was also a diplomat and revolutionary leader. He was Deputy Postmaster General of the American colonies and he reorganized the postal system. He proposed a plan of union for the colonies, which was rejected by both the colonial assemblies and the British government. He was sent to persuade the people of Canada to join the cause against Britain, and in 1776 he was appointed to the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence, which he signed. In 1778 Franklin also did much to gain French support for the new republic. In 1781 he was chosen as one of the American diplomats to negotiate peace with Britain. He was also President of Pennsylvania. Benjamin Franklin died in Philadelphia on 17 April 1790.'}

Lyric poetry, poetry, verse drama, and series of lectures on style followed, and then a third novelThe voyage(1924). In the 1920s, Murry's interests shifted from literature to religious philosophy, and in the 1930s he converted to Marxism and then moved politically towards pacifism. His writing of the period reflected these shifts in interest. Long an admirer of Keats, he wroteKeats and Shakespeare: a study of Keats' poetic life from 1816 to 1820(1925), andStudies in Keats(1930). Another literary portrait wasJonathan Swift: a critical biography(1954). Murry promoted the work of his wife, Katherine Mansfield, after her death in 1923, and his friendship with D. H.

bioghist
{'William Muir was born in Glasgow in 1819. He was educated at Kilmarnock Academy and then at Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities. After his university education he gained a post with the East India Company in the North-West Provinces of India. He entered the Bengal Civil Service in 1837 and became Secretary to the Governor of the North-West Provinces at Agra. His work, particularly during the Sepoy Mutiny (when he was in charge of the Intelligence Department) and his experience, influence, and writing on the history of Islam, led to his appointment in 1868 as Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces. He had been created Knight Commander of the Star of India in 1867. Between 1874 and 1876 Muir was Financial Minister to the Government of India, and from 1876 to 1885 he was a Member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India. On leaving India he joined the Council of India in London but resigned on his appointment as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Edinburgh University in 1885. During his term of office, the University underwent many changes as a result of the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889. Muir resigned in 1903 because of ill health and died at Dean Park House in Edinburgh on 11 July 1905.'}

Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split into four bundles: in bundles \'James Kennedy\' and \'Robert Kennedy\', they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles \'Marjory, James, Robert Kennedy\' and \'Miscellaneous\', they are in no particular order. Letters in bundle \'Miscellaneous\' are still folded, whereas all other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder \'\'Sir Granville Bantock\', D.19228, E61/19\', are in fair condition; 94 letters were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters and not to pages, two letters remain unnumbered. One further letter from Granville Bantock to Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, dated 25 Jul 1924, is in Gen. 278. Work Done - All items dusted with brush and put into new archive envelopes.

{'Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, singer, pianist, folk-song collector and arranger, was born in 1857. She was the daughter of singer David Kennedy (1825-1886). Her series of works The songs of the Hebrides, published variously between 1909 and 1922 remain a useful resource for both Gaelic and English speakers. She collected songs chiefly in the Western Isles. Aware that the material collected would, in the concert performance, lose something of the original essence, she provided the songs with sensitive accompaniment. For service rendered to the cause of music in Scotland, an honorary degree of Doctor of Music was conferred on her in 1928. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser had also been awarded the C.B.E. She died on 22 November 1930.'}

Between leaving school in 1955 and starting to write full-time in 1961, he held a variety of jobs including newspaper reporter, milkman, labourer in a market-garden, and ward orderly in a sanatorium. These jobs supported him in his poetry writing. In 1961, Nye moved to North Wales to absorb himself in full-time writing. Later on he settled in Edinburgh where he lived until 1977, then he moved to Ireland. In 1961, he published his first collection of poems, Juvenilia 1, and a second volume Juvenilia 2 was published in 1963. Around this time he became successful as a reviewer, becoming poetry editor for The Scotsman in 1967 and poetry critic for the Times in 1971.

{"In 1777 Princess Ekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova Dashkova arrived in Scotland with her son Paul (Pavel Mikhailovich Dashkov). Her son immediately began studies at Edinburgh University, and in 1779 the Princess, still resident in Edinburgh, gave a collection of Russian commemorative medals to mark the occasion of the graduation of Paul as a Master of Arts. The medals, over 150 in number and all made of copper, were entrusted first to Professor John Robison, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, who was instructed to make a catalogue of them. In the early 1770s, Robison had very briefly held the Chair of Mathematics in the Imperial Naval Cadet Corps at Kronstadt, where he had been given the rank of Colonel. The medals were only handed back to the University after Robison's death in 1805. If a catalogue was ever made by Robison it did not survive, and a proper catalogue of the collection still has to be compiled."}

{"History of Art (formerly the Department of Fine Art) is a popular and long-established department of Edinburgh University. It has the oldest full-time Chair of Art History in Britain which was founded in 1880. History of Art is located at Minto House, 20 Chambers Street, Edinburgh, opposite the Royal Museum of Scotland, and within easy walking distance of most of the galleries and museums of central Edinburgh. History of Art has book, slide and photographic collections, as well as a photographic unit. There is also a laboratory for the demonstration of metalworking techniques and methods of conservation. A collection of postcards in photo albums and small file drawers was gathered together by members of Fine Art staff (in the Department's early years) for use as teaching aids before the advent of the popular colour slide format. The early postcard collection is important in that the cards are primarily of European buildings, many of which were lost or damaged during the revolutions and conflicts of the 20th century."}

{"William Shepherd Morrison was born on 10 August 1893, one of eight sons of John Morrison of Torinturk, Argyll, and Marion Morrison. He was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, and during his schooling entered the Officers Training Corps (OTC), 1906-1912. He studied Arts and Law at Edinburgh University, beginning in 1912, and continued in the OTC Artillery, 1912-1914. When the First World War broke out, Morrison interrupted his studies and in August 1914 entered the Royal Field Artillery, Special Reserve, as a 2nd Lieutenant. In March 1915 he was wounded at Neuve Chapelle, a British offensive in the Artois region, and in March and June 1915 he was mentioned in Dispatches. In March 1915 he was awarded the Military Cross, and by June 1915 he was a Lieutenant, and September 1916 an Acting Captain. In January 1916 he was again mentioned in Dispatches, and in November 1917 he became a Captain. Once more, in March 1919, he was mentioned in Dispatches. Towards the end of hostilities, he served with the Scottish Command Gas School, 1918-1919. In 1919 he resigned his Commission. Morrison resumed his studies at Edinburgh University and while there was President of the University Union and Senior President of the Students Representative Council. He obtained the degree of M.A. in 1920. In 1923 he was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in London. Also in 1923, in December that year, and again in October 1924, in General Elections, he contested for the Unionists in the Western Isles, Scotland, campaigning in Gaelic. In 1924 too, he married Katharine Allison Swan, in Leith. She had also been a graduate of Edinburgh University and she too was reading for the Bar. As far as a political career was concerned, Morrison would not become an MP until 1929 when he won the constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury, in England, for the Conservatives. He would hold the seat though for some thirty years, until 1959. He became a KC (Kings Council) in 1934, and was appointed recorder of Walsall, Staffordshire, in 1935. He became Financial Secretary to the Treasury later that year. In 1936 he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and a member of the Privy Council. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of Food in 1939-40, Postmaster-General in 1940-42, and Minister of Town and Country Planning from 1943 until 1945 when his party went into Opposition. By 1951, the year when the Conservatives were returned to power, Morrison was a Bencher (or Master of the Bench) - a senior Inn of Court member - and from October 1951 to 1959 he was Speaker of the House of Commons presiding, for example, over debates on the Suez crisis in 1956. In 1959 he retired from the House and soon afterwards, in November 1959, he was chosen to succeed Sir William (Viscount) Slim as Governor-General of Australia. He was created Viscount Dunrossil of Vallaquie (on the island of North Uist, Outer Hebrides) and appointed G.C.M.G. Morrison had seven brothers: John Morrison, Donald Morrison, Alexander Morrison, Neil Morrison, Donald John Morrison, Cecil John Rhodes Morrison, and Roderick Morrison. In 1965, the Lord Lyon King of Arms recognised the eldest brother, John Morrison of Ruchdi, as chief of clan and name Morrison. Donald Morrison had studied pharmacology and then became a crofter and general merchant in North Uist. Alexander Morrison was a farmer in Canada, but was killed at Loos in 1915. Neil Morrison became a solicitor. Donald John Morrison - called 'Pwe' or 'DJ' - became a GP in Ballantrae, Ayrshire. Cecil John Rhodes Morrison became a doctor, a radiologist, in London. Sadly, Roderick Morrison died in infancy. William Shepherd Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil, died on 3 February 1961 at Government House, Canberra, Australia. After a state funeral, he was buried in the graveyard of the Church of St John the Baptist, Reid, Canberra. His eldest son, John Morrison, succeeded to the viscountcy.

{"Frederick Sleigh Roberts was the second son of General Sir Abraham Roberts, G.C.B. (1784-1873). He was born at Kanpur (then Cawnpore), India, on the 30 September 1832. Roberts was educated at Eton, Sandhurst and Addiscombe, and he obtained a commission in the Bengal Artillery on 12 December 1851. In the following year he was posted to a field battery at Peshawar, where he also acted as aide-de-camp to his father, who commanded the Peshawar division. Roberts was an outstanding combat leader in the Second Afghan War (1878-80) and the South African War (1899-1902). He became Commander-in-Chief in India (1885-1893), and was the last Commander-in-Chief of the British Army (1901-04) before the office was abolished. He had been made a Field-Marshal in 1895. Foreseeing World War I, he was one of the earliest advocates of compulsory military service. Roberts had first distinguished himself during the suppression of the Indian Mutiny (1857-58). On September 1, 1880, he scored the decisive victory of the Second Afghan War, defeating Ayub Khan's Afghan Army near Kandahar. In the South African War, he ended a succession of British defeats, and captured Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State Republic on 13 March 1900. He then annexed the state as the Orange River Colony in May 1900, and took the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria. He gave way to Horatio Herbert Kitchener as Commander-in-Chief in South Africa in November 1900. Roberts was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) in December 1858 for actions on 2 January 1858 at Khudaganj, India. He was created a Baron in 1892 and an Earl and Viscount in 1901.

{"Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit was born in 1585. He was the brother-in-law of William Drummond of Hawthornden, the poet. Scott was educated at St. Leonard's College, St. Andrews, entering it around 1600. He then studied abroad before returning to Scotland having been called to the Bar. In 1611 he acquired Tarvet and other land in Fife to which he gave the name Scotstarvet. In 1617 he was knighted by King James VI and was made a Privy Councillor.Sir John married three times. His first wife was Anne Drummond, the sister of Drummond of Hawthornden, his second was Elizabeth Melville, and his third Margaret Monpenny.Scott was an important supporter and patron of Scottish learning. He endowed the Chair of Humanity at St. Andrew's in 1620 and was responsible for advancing two major patriotic publication projects - theDelitiae poetarum Scotorum(1637) and the Scottish maps forBlaeu's Atlas Novus(1654). In honour of James VI he published a Latin poemHodoeporicon in serenissimi et invictissimi Principis Jacobi Sexti ex Scotia sua discessum.His late seventeenth century workThe Staggering State of the Scottish Statesmenwas a reflection on the instability of success, including his own fall from office after years of service to king and country.In 1637, when Charles I insisted, without consultation, on introducing an English-style prayerbook into Scotland, and brought bishops into government, it incited revolution in the form of the National Covenant which was signed at Greyfriar's Kirk, Edinburgh, in 1638, by nobles, ministers and thousands of ordinary Scots. That same year, at the parish church in Ceres, Fife, Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet subscribed to the Covenant too. The Covenant demanded a free Scottish Parliament and a free General Assembly - free from the monarch's interference. In 1640, he served on the committee of the Estates for the defence of the country (the Estates was the then Scottish Parliament). During the ensuing war between England and Scotland he served on the war committee in 1648 and 1649.Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit had been a Privy Councillor both to James VI and to King Charles I, and a Lord of Session, and Lord of Exchequer (Scotland). However, during Cromwell's Commonwealth he lost his positions of high office. These would not be given back to him after the Restoration either. He died at Scotstarvet in 1670.In the 18th century the estate of Scotstarvet was bought by Wemyss of Wemyss Hall (Wemyss Hall, near Cupar, Fife)."}

{'John Brown (fl. 1824-1834) and Thomas S. Brown (fl. 1828-1835) came from Lanarkshire and may have been brothers, possibly from Edmonston. They both studied medical subjects from the mid-1820s to the early-1830s at Edinburgh University and at the Royal Infirmary and other institutions in the city. William B. Clark, also a student in Edinburgh in the 1820s, went on to become a Minister in Canada preaching at Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Quebec City. From the class cards and tickets, library tickets and letters of certification it is possible to trace the study pattern of the men - studies under the great professors of nineteenth century Edinburgh - at the University, the Royal Infirmary, the Edinburgh New Town Dispensary, and at the Royal College of Surgeons. John Brown appeared to have been studying from at least November 1824 when the class cards show that he attended classes in Greek given by Professor George Dunbar. In 1825 he took classes in Anatomy and Surgery offered by John Barclay MD and the well known Robert Knox MD. Throughout 1926-1927 he studied the principles and Practice of Surgery and Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Surgery under Alexander Monro (presumably Professor Alexander Monro tertius (1773-1859) , as well as Institutions of Medicine given by Andrew Duncan, Chemistry given by Andrew Fyfe, and Chemistry and Pharmacy by Thomas Charles Hope. In 1827-1828 there were studies and practices in Pathological Anatomy, Midwifery, Surgery, Principles and Practice of Surgery, Operative Surgery (again under Robert Knox), Practical Chemistry, Materia Medica, and Dietetics and Pharmacy (given by Andrew Duncan), Practical Anatomy, and Military Surgery (given by George Ballingall), as well as attendance at Anatomical Demonstrations. In 1829 he was studying Botany, and the Institutes of Medicine, and he was attending Clinical Lectures. In 1829 he was admitted to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1834 he studies Practical Chemistry and Pharmacy under William Gregory MD. There are undated cards showing study in the Junior Humanity class under James Pillans, and the prectice of Medicine under James Home. There are no cards showing studies after 1834. Thomas S. Brown may have attended Edinburgh Academy (at least between 1828-1829) prior to studying Medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1831 he was issued with a University Library card and that study year he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons Museum and he attended the Junior Humanity class offered by James Pillans, as well as the Chemistry and Pharmacy class given by Charles Hope. In 1832 he was admitted to classes in Mechanical Philosophy given by George Lees, Surgery given by John W. Turner, Materia Medica given by Robert Christison, Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery, and Anatomy and Physiology given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. In 1833 Brown was a pupil in the Laboratory of the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh and he also attended Clinical Lectures in Surgery and Principles and Practice of Surgery given by John Lizars. Between 1833 and 1834 he attended classes in Institutions of Medicine given by John Fletcher, Midwifery given by John Thatcher, and Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. William B. Clark had studied Logic and Metaphysics under David Ritchie in November 1824.'}
