Scope and Contents
"Manuscript notes in three separate notebooks. One notebook has 'Costain and Watson. Vol.II from 1865' written in ink at the top of the front cover.

Another notebook has 'Newcastle's Electioneering' written in ink at the top of the front cover, with the first page having notes entitled 'Essay on Cromwell's Principles of Gov' followed by lists of names - probably local school, college or university students - and their grades for the Cromwell essay. A third notebook has no identifying title on the front cover, and the first page is taken up with the question of 'the social and economic conditions of Engand in the first half of the Seventeenth Century'. The content of the notebooks, overall, cover 17th, 18th and 19th century British history."

Biographical / Historical
"The notebooks - 'University Notes' - are those produced in earlier decades by Andrew Baxendine and Sons, University and School Booksellers, 14-15 Chambers Street, Edinburgh, which had been established in 1885. Given the content of the notebooks, they may have belonged to a member of local school, college, or university teaching staff."
