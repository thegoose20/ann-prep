Biographical / Historical
"Covenants such as this Confession of Faith and Covenant of the Church of Scotland in 1638, and again in 1643, which committed the individual and the nation to God, resulted in religious struggle. These public petitions presumed a Scottish relationship with God without a king or queen's interference. Although the text did not state it, copies of the documents signed throughout the country provided an excuse to condemn the episcopal system of Church administration."
