Biographical / Historical
"The German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD) was founded in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1925. It has a long tradition of uniting people and academia and is one of the most important funding organisations in the world for the international exchange of students and researchers. In 1983, a DAAD 'Weekend for Anglisten in Scotland' was organised and dedicated to Robert Burns, and it took place at The Burn, near Edzell, in Angus. Norman MacCaig (1910-1996), the poet, was invited to give a poetry reading on the evening of Saturday 5 March 1983. The Burn, at the foot of Glenesk, is a small estate with mansion house originally built for General Lord Adam Gordon between 1791 and 1796. In the 1930s, the house was completely remodelled and modernised to provide a unique study and short-break centre to student groups from all parts of the world."
