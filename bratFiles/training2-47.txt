Biographical / Historical
"Peter McIntyre was born in the 1920s and was raised in Dunbar, East Lothian, where he attended Dunbar Secondary School. He studied at Edinburgh University, entering in 1937. The Second World War however intervened and he served with the Army Educational Corps in India reaching the rank of Warrant Officer First Class. McIntyre returned to Edinburgh in 1946 to resume his studies, and he was awarded a First Class Honours degree (MA) in History in July 1948 (although the University Calendar records the award as 1948, the 'University of Edinburgh Journal' records the MA as 1940 as does the Library's card index file). After graduation he joined the staff of W. and R. Chambers, printers and publishers, becoming an editor and indexer. In 1954 he moved to the editorial staff of the University Press in Edinburgh. There, among many tasks, he collaborated with Professor D. Talbot Rice, writing the biographies for the work The university portraits (1957). McIntyre was also well known as Clerk to the University Senate, and later on as Academic Secretary, though illness meant he had to leave the latter post in 1966. He continued work with Edinburgh University however as Editor of the University Calendar and other University publications. McIntyre's publications included: a pamphlet entitled The Robes about University of Edinburgh formal robes for the Principal, Chancellor and Rector; a pamphlet on The Old College; a chapter entitled The Franchise Courts for the work Introduction to Scottish Legal History; and, A University within a city...a brief history of the University for the University of Edinburgh Bulletin, Vol.13. No.7. 4 February 1977. At the time of his death he was, according to his daughter, working on a pamphlet on The Old College Statuette (of Sir Cowasji Jehangir). Outside of his work with Edinburgh University he maintained a life long interest in Scottish history. Peter McIntyre died in London on 14 June 1982. His funeral was held at St. Anne's, Dunbar, East Lothian."
