Biographical / Historical
'The Genetics of Paramecium aurelia was published by Cambridge University Press in 1954 as Volume 2 in their Cambridge Monographs in Experimental Biology series.', "These notes relate to Beale's work on intragenic recombination among the antigen-determining genes in Paramecium. Beale constructed heterozygotes involving various combinations of different 'd' antigen alleles, passed them through autogamy and screened the progeny with sera capable of immobilising the parental types. Theoretically intragenic recombinants should have appeared, but the only novel types Beale got turned out to be 'nuls' - i.e. cells unable to express any antigen controlled by the locus corresponding to the original types used.", "The FASEB Conference on Ciliate Molecular Biology took place from 07-12 August 1999 at Saxton's River, Vermont.", "These notes were most probably made when Beale was working in Indiana University, Bloomington, in Tracy Sonneborn's laboratory.", 'Beale was awarded a five-year programme grant by the Medical Research Council in 1972 for research on the genetics of malaria parasites. The research involved carrying out work on rodent malaria parasites Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium vinckei, with the aim of improving an understanding of the basic biology of the human malaria parasite.', 'In 1976, Beale was awarded a Royal Society Visiting Professorship to spend six months at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, lecturing on his Edinburgh work on the genetics of malaria parasites. During this visit he began a collaborative research programme on malaria parasites with some interested Thai scientists, including Professor Sodsri Thaithong. Beale would visit Bangkok annually for the following 20 years to assist with the work, which involved making collections of Plasmodium falciparum from different malarial endemic areas of Thailand and characterising the cultured parasites in various ways, including enzyme typing and drug resistance testing. Ultimately, over 1000 separate isolates were obtained and preserved in liquid nitrogen. Beale also developed a new technique for preparing pure clones of malaria parasites by micromanipulation (Beale and Thaithing, 1991). The malaria work led to a great deal of collaboration between the two research groups in Edinburgh and Thailand, and in 1992 Beale and Thaithong published a book summarising their work. Beale received an honorary doctorate from Chulalongkorn University in 1996.', "Beale conducted research with Luporini and F. Dini on 'Mutants and recombinants at the locus mat in the protozoan ciliate Euplotes' at the University of Camerino, Italy in 1989.", 'Beale was awarded a three-year grant by the Science Research Council in 1966 towards the cost of an investigation into Protozoan Genetics. He received further grants in 1972, for a research project on the Developmental Biology of Paramecium, and in 1975, for a project on Mitochondrial Biogenesis in Paramecium.', 'Beale visited the Medical Research Council Research Unit in the Gambia, West Africa in September 1972 as part of research for his MRC-funded project on the genetics of malaria parasites.', 'Richard Carter gained his PhD in Genetics from the University of Edinburgh in 1971. He was involved with the early development of genetic analysis of malaria parasites using a rodent malaria and initiated the study of population genetics in human malaria. He returned to the University of Edinburgh in 1986 after spells in America and Sri Lanka, utilising genomic techniques for the genetic analysis of malaria parasites.', "Beale first joined the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known), in 1935 as a volunteer assistant, after graduating from Imperial College, London. He was shortly offered paid employment by J.B.S. Haldane, who was then part-time head of the genetics group until 1941. Beale later claimed that 'the appointment at John Innes was a marvellous step forward as the Institution was at that time the liveliest place for research in genetics in Britain, rivalled only by Crew's Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh.' Beale's studies encompassed Neurospora and Verbena before he was called up for military service in January 1941.", 'The paper was published in Molecular and Cellular Biology, 19 (11):7792-800 (1999).', "Sodsri et al's paper was published in Experimental Parasitology, 98 (2), 59-70 (2001).", "Koizumi's paper 'Microinjection and transfer of cytoplasm in Paramecium' was published in Experimental Cell Research, 88, 74-78 (1974).", "These notes most probably date from Beale's time at the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known), between 1935 and 1941.", "The Wellcome Trust awarded Beale £1,000 to supplement his visit to Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand in 1976-1977 as part of his Royal Society Overseas Visiting Professorship award. Further awards were received in 1977, for research on the typing of malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax (under the Tropical Medicine Research Awards scheme); in 1979, for a year's extension to the latter project, focusing on variation in falciparum malaria; in 1980, for an extension to the study of cloning of Plasmodium falciparum and for an extension to Andrew Tait's fellowship studying the speciation and genetics of Africa trypanosomes; and in 1982 for genetic studies on antigens of malaria parasites.", 'The article was published in Trends in Genetics in No. 6, pp.137-140 (1990).', "Beale's first trip to Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, was in 1976, when he was awarded a six-month Royal Society Visiting Professorship. Beale used this opportunity to establish a collaborative research programme on malaria with Professor Sodsri Thaithong, and returned on numerous occasions over the next twenty years. As these notes show, Beale also delivered lectures to students at Chulalongkorn University on his visits there.", "In 1977 the Institute of Animal Genetics was designated the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Research on the Genetics of Malaria Parasites. Beale and Sodsri Thaithong of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, were awarded a collaborative grant for the research projects 'Enzyme typing of human malaria parasites' and 'Genetics of malaria parasites.'", 'Beale visited the Soviet Union from 11-31 March 1968 as part of an exchange visit of scientists between the Royal Society and the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Beale spent ten days in Moscow, four in Tbilisi and six in Leningrad, visiting various scientific institutions and giving lectures.', 'Beale visited Chulalongkorn University as a Royal Society Leverhulme Visiting Professor, with support from the Wellcome Trust, from November 1976 to May 1977. His visit was to obtain first-hand information about malaria and to collect samples of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.', 'Extranuclear Genetics, by Geoffrey Beale and J.C.K. Knowles, was published by Edward Arnold in 1978.', 'Beale had visited the University of California, Berkeley in 1964 as Visiting Lecturer, where he also delivered some lecture courses on genetics.', "This notebook dates from Beale's period of time at the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known), where he was appointed in 1935.", 'This material was most likely collated by Beale whilst preparing his memoir of Sonneborn for the Royal Society, which was published in 1982.', "Jonathan Knowles joined Beale's laboratory in 1970 on a Medical Research Centre scholarship for Training and Research Methods. He remained for the next five years and developed techniques for micro-injections of mitochondria into living paramecia. Beale and Knowles also collaborated on a book, Extranuclear Genetics, published by Edward Arnold in 1978.", "Beale's article concerning Nikolai Vavilov was published in the Encylopedia Britannica in 1958. Beale also contributed an article concerning August Weismann for the same edition.", "Beale's book, Paramecium Genetics and Epigenetics, written collaboratively with John Preer Jr., was published by Routledge, Taylor and Francis in 2008. Chapter 4, eventually titled 'Methods of Studying Genetics Processes in Organisms of the Paramecium aurelia Species Group', discussed, among other things, W. John Haynes' work on gene cloning.", 'This paper was published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 14 (1):122-30 (2000).', "Henrik Kacser began studying for a diploma in animal genetics within the Institute of Animal Genetics in 1951, after gaining his doctorate in physical chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast. He made such a good impression that C.H. Waddington, at Beale's recommendation, asked Kacser if he would like to stay on as lecturer. He remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life, working chiefly on physical and chemical approaches to biology, including metabolic control analysis. This material was most likely gathered together as part of the research for Beale's obituary of Kacser, which he wrote with Grahame Bulfield for the Royal Society.", "Beale gained MRC funding in 1966 to embark on a programme conducting genetic analyses of malaria parasites. Walliker was suggested to Beale as a collaborator by Professor P.C.C. Garnham at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who had supervised Garnham's PhD on fish parasites. By early 1970, the first genetic cross had been successfully conducted in a rodent malaria parasite, which demonstrated the Mendelian nature of genetic inheritance of malaria parasites. Walliker took over the direction of this project after Beale's retirement and became the leading figure in the Edinburgh malaria genetics programme. In 1986, Walliker was made an honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh.", "Klaus Heckmann visited Beale's laboratory at the Institute of Animal Genetics, Edinburgh, for a short period during 1964.", 'The Royal Society delegation, of which Waddington was part, visited laboratories in Peking and Shanghai, travelling to and from China via Moscow.', "Beale's personal and professional relationship with Tracy Sonneborn began with their first meeting in 1947 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Beale was working at the time. Sonneborn invited Beale to join his research group in Indiana University Bloomington, which led to Beale's lifelong interest in Paramecium. Beale remained in contact with Sonneborn for the rest of his life, and authored a biographical memoir of Sonneborn for the Royal Society, published in 1982.", "Beale's book, Paramecium Genetics and Epigenetics, written collaboratively with John Preer Jr., was published by Routledge, Taylor and Francis in 2008.", "Geoffrey Beale was Ian Gibson's PhD supervisor between 1960 and1963. They published three collaborative papers on Paramecium from 1961 and postulated a new concept, the 'metagon', envisaged as a stable RNA-containing cytoplasmic entity necessary for the maintenance of bacterium-like 'mu' particles (this theory was later invalidated). Gibson later worked with Beale's old mentor, Tracy Sonneborn, at Indiana University before moving to the University of East Anglia where he established a protozoan genetics research group. He was the first to establish homologies between different taxonomic groupings of protozoa.", "Charlotte Auerbach arrived at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1933 after being forced to flee Germany and the anti-Semitic laws in place there at the time. Auerbach became best known for her 1941 discovery with J.M. Robson that mustard gas causes mutagenesis. This material was likely gathered together as part of Beale's preparation of his biographical memoir of Auerbach which was published by the Royal Society in 1995. Beale also published an article 'The Discovery of Mustard Gas Mutagenesis by Auerbach and Robson in 1941', which appeared in Genetics, 134, 393-399 (1993).", "The Paramecium stock, which became known as stock 540, was collected by Tracy Sonneborn in Mexico. Sonneborn sent the stock to Beale in Edinburgh in 1956, where it was discovered that the stock was a 'mate-killer' and containined 'mu' particles in the cytoplasm.", "Beale's interest in Russia stemmed from the Second World War, when he was in the Intelligence Corps (Field Security) Army Base Unit convoy posted in Archangel in 1941. Beale had some Russian already and was fluent by the time he returned. He kept up a correspondence with various Russian scientists throughout his lifetime, and retained an interest in the fate of science during the Soviet Union, particularly the career of Soviet biologist and agronomist Trofim Lysenko.", "John Preer Jr. would collaborate with Beale on numerous scientific papers, as well as, most notably, on Beale's book Paramecium: Genetics and Epigenetics (2008).", 'Beale was presented with an honorary doctorate from Chulalongkorn University by the King of Thailand on 11 July 1996.', 'Beale visited the University of California, Berkeley in 1964 as Visiting Lecturer, where he also delivered some lecture courses on genetics.', "Beale first met the American biologist Tracy Sonneborn in 1947 at a summer symposium at Cold Spring Harbor, where Beale was working at the time. Sonneborn invited Beale to join his group at Indiana University, Bloomington, to work on the protozoan group Paramecium. Beale remained in Bloomington for nine months from October 1947, and would pay many subsequent visits, enjoying the congenial atmosphere and Sonneborn's company. Beale's work on Paramecium genetics would continue for many years throughout his career, as would his correspondence with Sonneborn. When Sonneborn died in 1981, Beale wrote his biographical memoir for the Royal Society.", "This material appears to have been gathered together as part of the research for Beale's book Paramecium Genetics and Epigenetics, written collaboratively with John Preer Jr., and published by Routledge, Taylor and Francis in 2008.", 'Bland Finlay was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 2004.', "These notes were most probably made when Beale was working in Indiana University, Bloomington, in Tracy Sonneborn's laboratory. At this time Beale was studying the change from serotype D to serotype B of stock 51 (variant 4). The cells were treated with an immunising and potentially lethal solution containing anti-D antibodies, which lead to the cells becoming 'resistant' to the immunising action. Tracy Sonneborn had previously shown that the 'sensitive' and 'resistant' types of cell were 'hereditary'. Beale demonstrated that this change involved a replacement of the initial antigen (D) by another one (B) which could take place in every cell which was treated, and that for an intermediate period, both antigens could be detected in a single cell. Beale published a paper on the subject in 1948 entitled 'The process of transformation of antigenic type in Paramecium' which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, USA (34, 418-423).", 'This article appeared in the Encyclopedia of Genetics, edited by Eric Reeve, which was published by Routledge in 2001.', "Beale was working at this time at the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known). 'The genetics of Verbena I' appeared in the Journal of Genetics, 37 in 1939 and his collaborative paper with Rose Scott-Moncrieff and J.R. Price, 'The genetics of Verbena II: Chemistry of the flower colour variations' appeared in 1940.", 'These notes most likely relate to the Diploma course in Genetics which was begun within the Institute of Animal Genetics in 1948 and which was open to Honours students of the University of Edinburgh and beyond.', "Some of these notes refer to Beale's 'metagon' theory, which postulated that certain genes might liberate in the cytoplasm of Paramecia invisible entities called 'metagons' which control the ability of the cell to permit growth of visible endosymbiotic 'mu' (mate-killer) particles. Beale's key paper about the metagon was published in collaboration with Ian Gibson in 1962. Ultimately, however, it had to be abandoned, because Beale was unable to discover any consistent results from later experiments. 'Kappa' and 'Lambda' refer to certain symbionts of Paramecium.", "These notes most likely date from Beale's time as a Biology student at Imperial College, London.", 'Eric Reeve was the editor of the Encyclopedia of Genetics, which was published by Routledge in 2001.', "Beale and Jurand published five joint papers between 1960 and 1966. In 1970, Jurand was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh following Beale's nomination of him.", 'It is likely that Beale collected these offprints as part of the preparation for his memoir of Sonneborn.', 'These lectures took place over several years at the University of Edinburgh, and were given initially as part of a Race Relations Course. Grahame Bulfield gradually took over the lectures from Beale until they stopped in autumn 1975.', 'The book Paramecium: Genetics and Epigenetics was published by Taylor and Francis in 2008, and was co-authored by John Preer Jr.', "The Protozoan Genetics Unit was funded by the University of Edinburgh and the Wellcome Trust. The laboratory housed Beale's unit and provided facilities for Professor Martin Pollock and his group of bacteriologists.", 'Beale visited Japan from April to May 1973 as an exchange scientist as part of the exchange programme between the Royal Society and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.', "These files seem to relate to research which Beale was conducting with Piero Luporini relating to the unusual properties of inducing mating of Euplotes minuta strain '1A' in other species of Euplotes. The study was attempting to 'further characterise the purified E. minuta pheromone and study its binding to the different cell types, in order to understand the basis of this unusual case of interspecific cell recognition and mating induction.'", "Beale was awarded a three-year grant by the Medical Research Council in 1966 for a research project on 'the genetics of malaria parasites.' In 1968 the MRC awarded a supplementary grant to cover the expense of collecting additional strains of Plasmodium berghei from Africa. In 1969 an extension for a further three years was awarded.", "Andrew Tait worked on Paramecium in Beale's laboratory from 1966 firstly as a PhD student and then as a postdoctoral researcher. He later moved to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Glasgow."
