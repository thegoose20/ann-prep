Biographical / Historical
"Helen Wilson of Colquhalzie was the daughter-in-law of Sir John Wilson (1844-1918), businessman, Unionist politician, Chairman of the Wilsons and Clyde Coal Company, and MP for Falkirk Burghs from 1895 to 1906. Helen's husband, James Wilson - Sir John's son - was a captain with the Lanarkshire Yeomenry in Gallipoli and Egypt. For the war effort, various Home Front groups and organisations produced entertainments to raise funds for the Red Cross and other organisations. Rehearsals for entertainments by a theatrical group - 'The Eves' - were held at the Home of Helen Wilson at Colquhalzie in Perth. One of their performances took place at the local village hall at Muthill in aid of the National Work Party. Other performances were at Porteous Hall, Crieff, in aid of the Scottish Red Cross, and at the Pavilion Hall, Glasgow. Most of the cast of 'The Eves' were female and the name of their group was derived from the fact that their husbands, brothers, and fathers (the Adams) were serving in the forces. They offered sketches taken from London musical theatre productions, songs, recitations, choruses and dances. They were accompanied by piano or by the Auchterarder Ladies Orchestra."
