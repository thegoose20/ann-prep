Biographical / Historical
"For the Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd., Atlantic passenger carrying would last barely four decades from 1921. In the 1960s when air travel and cargo containerisation started to compete with North Atlantic shipping companies, passenger ships were gradually sold and new container and bulk cargo vessels built. The firm moved with the times. The 'Empress of Britain' of the 1950 and 1960s was the third Canadian Pacific ship of that name. Built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow and the sister ship of the 'Empress of England' which came into service a year after the 'Empress of Britain', the 25,526 ton ship was launched by Queen Elizabeth II at Govan on 22 June 1955. The ship was said to be the first of the North Atlantic liners to be completely air-conditioned. The ship's maiden voyage began on 20 April 1956 from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal, the company's summer route. The 'Empress of Britain' served only seven years on the route and its final Liverpool trip began on 3 September 1963. Verna Isaac, of Wichita, Kansas, sailed on the 'Empress of Britain' (Tourist Class) on Tuesday 22 August 1961 westbound across the Atlantic from Liverpool to Montreal where it arrived on 29 August. The sailing was via Greenock and Quebec."
