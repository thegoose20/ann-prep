"The science writer and philosopher Thomas Dick was born in Hilltown, Dundee, on 24 November 1774. He was the son of a handloom weaver. He was inspired towards science on seeing a bright meteor in 1783. In 1794 he entered Edinburgh University supporting himself by private tutoring, but he did not proceed to taking the MA degree because of the additional fees. From 1801 he pursued a religious career, entering the Theological Hall of the General Associate Synod of the Secession Church. He was ordained in 1803, became married in 1804, but in 1805 was deposed and excommunicated from the presbytery on being found guilty of adultery. In 1807 Dick turned to teaching, becoming a schoolmaster in Methven and forming a mechanics' institute. In 1817 he left Methven for Perth and a post at Stewart's Free Trades' School. As well as teaching he involved himself in astronomical observations and built a telescope. He published articles in literary, religious and scientific publications, and these included Christian philosopher, or, The connection of science and philosophy with religion (1832), Philosophy of religion (1826), Philosophy of a future state (1828), Celestial scenery (1837), and Practical astronomer (1845).
