Biographical / Historical
"This is a manuscript common-place book of original lyric verse, from c. 1827-1839, and with numerous pen and ink drawings and watercolours. The poems are mostly of a sentimental religious nature, distinctly rural, and with a few of a topical nature. Topical lines include an opening poem on Napoleon, the death of Canning, the death of the opera-singer Maria Malibran, and one on the accession of Queen Victoria. Some are family orientated and include watercolour portraits - 'Letitia. On her return from Bath 21 Dec. 1837' and 'On Ben's birth day, 12 November 1837'. There is a poem entitled 'Crypt Bells' referring to Gloucester's 'Cloister'd scenes', which together with the reference to Bath may offer a clue to the location of the unknown writer."
