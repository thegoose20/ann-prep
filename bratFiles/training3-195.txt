"Content Description Papers - correspondence and copies of circulars - relating to a possible Oppenheim Bequest, Edinburgh University, covering the period from March 1984 to December 1986.The initial correspondence talks of the creation of 'a Memorial' to the 'close connection' of Oppenheim 'with the University and the City of Edinburgh', and how best this might be achieved. His widow - Mrs. Enid Oppenheim - 'had expressed a wish' that the Memorial could be identified with 'the training of business executives', and associated with 'Accounting, Business Studies, Industrial and other Law Classes'. The Memorial was to be known as the 'Oppenheim Bequest'. The correspondence describes the various proposals discussed... many of which appeared to have engendered doubt.The papers contain copies of material relating to: a Business Studies building... Buccleuch Church; newspaper cutting relating to business studies... MBAs specifically; Edinburgh Management School; and, an Electronic Financial Library."
