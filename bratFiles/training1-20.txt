Scope and Contents
"The volume has the armorial book-plate of George Brock M.D. (Georgius Brock M.D.). The text in the volume begins with a quotation from Cullen, so the author of the manuscript was doubtless a follower or student of Cullen whose name is invoked several times subsequently. To begin with the text is concerned with materia medica and the nutritional qualities of foodstuffs. later the text is more various, with topics including physiology and also asphyxiation. A dispute within the Royal College of Physicians is discussed. There are also notes on natural history and geology. At the end of the volume are a few pages of 'original poetry' dated 1821 and in various hands identified by initials."
