Biographical / Historical
"The first use of paper has been excavated in China dating to the 2nd century BC. It was used for the purposes of wrapping or padding protection for delicate bronze mirrors. It was also used for the padding of poisonous medicines and potions. By the 3rd century AD, the use of paper for writing became widespread. In the period of the Tang Dynasty paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of tea, and the the government of the Song Dynasty produced the world's first known paper-printed money. After its origin in central China, the production and use of paper spread steadily, to Japan, to the Middle East and to Europe."
