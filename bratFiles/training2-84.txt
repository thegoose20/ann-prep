He was educated at Stowe, Heidelberg, Christ Church Oxford, and Edinburgh University. At Edinburgh he studied Scots Law, and took a Ph.D. with a thesis on the Scots law of succession to peerages.

During the Second World War he served in the Scots Guards and was ADC to General Sir Andrew Thorne, 1944-1945, military liaison officer to Admiral Sir William Whitworth, and attache and private secretary to the British Ambassador in Moscow in 1946. In 1950, Moncrieffe was called to the Scottish Bar. He became a Q.C. in 1980. He was a member of the Royal Company of Archers, the Queen's Body Guard for Scotland, and was Chairman of Debrett's Peerage Ltd., 1977-1981, and President of Burke's from 1983.
