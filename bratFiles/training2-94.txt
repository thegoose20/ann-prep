Scope and Contents
"At E2010.16 there is an 'autograph letter signed' from Thomas Lyle to John Aitken at Gayfield Square, Edinburgh, dated 28 May 1827. The letter is concerned with Lyle's compilation Ancient ballads and songs and how, having received 'notice from Mr. Lumisden', he is aware of Aitken's 'willingness to suggest a few amendments and additions to the Lyrical MS'. Lyle has heard much about 'Mr Aitken's abilities, from Glasgow friends', and would regard 'any little assistance' while the 'work is going through the press' to be 'a particular favour'."
