Biographical / Historical
"The London County Council had its own Press Bureau at County Hall on London's South Bank, which produced and distributed Press Releases announcing significant events or decisions. Percy Johnson-Marshall collected press releases which related to the work of the Architect's Department - architecture, housing or city planning. Further public relations for the Architect's Department were achieved through publication of articles concerning their work in professional journals and newspapers. Percy Johnson-Marshall kept a file of these, and may have been the author of some of them.", "During his membership of the Association of Building Professionals (ABT), Percy Johnson-Marshall was a member of a number of committees. He was chair of the Architects' Professional Advisory Committee and secretary of the Planning Committee from 1948-1950. In addition he participated in the work of the Technical Committee, the Education Committee and the Student Liaison Committee. Percy Johnson-Marshall also attended meetings of the Executive Committee and the General Council and retained some of the papers for future reference.", 'In the early 1970s, local authorities moved towards city development plans that were compiled from local plans of specific areas. Conservation, as well as redevelopment, was by this time high on the agenda. The South Side locality of Edinburgh, designated by the local authority in 1972, contained much of the land involved in the University Comprehensive Development Area (CDA). This CDA scheme was stagnant by 1970 and officially extinct in 1975. Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates were commissioned by the City of Edinburgh to prepare the South Side Local Plan, reporting on housing quality, residency and population, commercial uses and buildings of architectural interest (1973-1975). Johnson-Marshall was also required to report to the University Development Committee on the progress of the South Side Local Plan and its implications for the University of Edinburgh.', "London County Council Architect's Department acquired a large quantity of photographs of London pre World War II and post blitz, as well as generating images of its own exhibitions, models and developments, both in construction and complete. Many of these were intended for its own publications, exhibitions and for press distribution.", "The University of Edinburgh Mound / Lawnmarket Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) involved a large block of historic structures in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, including New College, Mylne's Court, James Court, the Outlook Tower, Lister House, and Semple's Court. New College and some residential properties, all badly in need of restoration, were transferred from the Church of Scotland to the University in 1961. Ian G Lindsay & Partners were then engaged as architects for the restoration of New College and to produce a feasibility study for the conversion of Mylne's Court for student accommodation. In 1964 the University launched a Comprehensive Development Area project with the intention of creating a complex of student residences by purchasing and rehabilitating all the properties in the area. Percy Johnson-Marshall was made planning consultant with John Reid, of Ian Lindsay & Partners, as specialist conservation architects and Hall & Sons as consulting engineers. Mylne's Court was successfully converted in two phases, Philip Henman Hall and Edward Salveson Hall (1966-1970). Other conversion projects within the CDA - James Court, the Outlook Tower and Semple's Close - were abandoned for economic reasons and the properties disposed of. With the exception of Lister House, which was reconstructed and re-opened as Patrick Geddes Hall in 1978, named after Sir Patrick Geddes who worked from the Outlook Tower during the 1890s. A scheme by architect John Reid, of Ian G Lindsay & Partners for an entirely new student hostel, together with a lecture room extension for New College was abandoned, in 1970, in favour of full restoration of New College.", 'While posted with the British Army in India, during World War II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) from 1943 until his repatriation in 1945. One of his duties was the administration of the organisation. He kept a number of files concerning this, some in a numbered series and the remainder unnumbered. The files described in this series are those which have been recovered.', 'Additional sites of importance to the University of Edinburgh included its playing fields at Peffermill, to the south-east of the city. A site dedicated to student residences at Salisbury Green, just to the east of the central area, was developed from 1955 as the Pollock Halls of Residence and named in honour of the donor of the land, Sir John Donald Pollock. The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies became part of the University in 1951 and there was development of its sites at Summerhall (1969-1971), just south of the central area and at the Bush Estate (1952), to the north-west of the city.', 'After leaving Liverpool School of Architecture at the University of Liverpool, Percy Johnson-Marshall, along with fellow former student Robert H Shaw, were instrumental in setting up the Liverpool School of Architecture Society as a club for former students. He established the club collected names and addresses and organised an inaugural dinner on the 25 March 1938 which over 50 attended. At this dinner a committee was formed to administer the club, with Professor Lionel Bailey Budden as President, Robert Joseph Gardner-Medwin amongst the Executive Committee and Percy Johnson-Marshall as the Honorary Secretary . The club does not appear to have had a long-life, with the last mentioned activity in this collection being a film and supper evening on the 27 October 1938.', 'Percy Johnson-Marshall was Honorary Secretary of the Coventry Branch of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA), while working for Donald Gibson\'s team at Coventry City Architectural and Planning Department. The Branch mounted a week long exhibition entitled "Coventry of tomorrow: towards a beautiful city" from 6-13 May 1940. This was the culmination of a publicity campaign aiming to generate local enthusiasm for new plans of the city which had been created by Gibson\'s team. The ideas presented at the exhibition pre-dated the World War II bombing, which started on 14 November 1940, which led to the requirement for comprehensive redevelopment plans for the city. The AASTA became became the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) in 1942.', 'While studying for both the Diploma in Architecture and the Certificate in Civic Design at the University of Liverpool, Percy Johnson-Marshall entered architectural designs for a number of prize competitions, in addition to his course work. On two occasions he entered as a partnership, once with his brother Stirrat Johnson-Marshall and once with a colleague JH Parker. He was successful in winning the HW Williams Prize for the Promotion of Architectural Design in Concrete also in 1936 for his design of a "Bus station for Liverpool".', 'During World War II, Coventry civic centre was destroyed by bomb damage. The raid on 14 November 1940 made it necessary to completely rebuild the area. City Architect Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson took the opportunity to further develop his planning ideas which he had already displayed in the "Coventry of Tomorrow Exhibition" held between 6-13 May 1940. As a member of Gibson\'s team, between1938-1941, Percy Johnson-Marshall took an active part in the planning process. He collected photographs of the architectural models which he participated in creating and of the redevelopment plans these were derived from. He also collected press clippings with articles relating to the redevelopment. After leaving Coventry City Council for active service in India and Burma Johnson-Marshall retained his interest in the project and continued to collect press clippings, plans and related papers. He later used these as the basis for a chapter in his book Rebuilding Cities ( 1966)', "Sir Robert Hogg Matthew first proposed the University of Edinburgh/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) in 1960. This would bring together the University of Edinburgh, the Corporation of the City of Edinburgh and private enterprise to create one coherent redevelopment plan. Percy Johnson-Marshall was appointed Planning Consultant to the University of Edinburgh in 1962 following a viability survey and interim report the previous year. His scheme proposed a tripartite megastructure, with upper-level pedestrian circulation and traffic segregation. The Nicolson Street commercial area would be flanked by University structures to the west and an area, designated for redevelopment by the Corporation for housing purposes, to the east. The University development proceeded on the assumption that the CDA would achieve statutory status, with Johnson-Marshall supervising its design and negotiating with the City Planning Department of the Corporation of the City of Edinburgh and, for a time, a private developer, Ravenseft Properties Limited. The CDA was superseded by the South Side Local Plan ( 1975) , prepared for the Corporation by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates. Johnson-Marshall remained planning consultant to the University until 1985, with Bristo Square, designed by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates, and completed in 1982, the final element to the University's unfinished scheme.", 'London County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 3, the Bermondsey Reconstruction Area was created in 1949. It consisted of 117 acres of warehouses, docks and housing, which had suffered extensive bomb damage during World War II. Redevelopment by London County Council was mainly residential schemes, including the Canada housing estate, which mixed tall towers and four-storey maisonettes.', "In England the tiered system of political representation entails local authorities, which exercise a measure of devolved power from the national government of the United Kingdom. The regional, or city, council is an elected body of representatives controlling certain aspects of the administration of local government. The council, or corporation, employs a body of professional officials, essentially civil servants, both administrative and technical, to undertake its work. A variety of departments, such as Parks or Housing, with their own staff, are directed by committees of councillors, which are specific to the remit of each department. Larger departments often require sub-committees, although all the committees are technically sub-committees of the Full Council and its vote. The committees and sub- committees of London County Council generated a body of material including agendas for, and minutes of, their meetings. The committees were informed by a variety of reports from the London County Council's own officials, as well as from national governmental bodies and independent professional bodies.", "While employed by Willesden Borough Council, Percy Johnson-Marshall collected copies of architectural plans for some of the borough's public building projects. These are mostly attributed to the borough engineer F Wilkinson and his successor F Wayman Brown, and include school extensions, housing developments, an electricity showroom and a refuse plant. Percy Johnson-Marshall worked on a number of these projects, and his initials appear on a some of the plans.", 'The University of Edinburgh/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) was mapped out by Percy Johnson-Marshall, Planning Consultant, in 1961-1962. All University building work in the central area was subject to this overall plan. Building projects and proposed developments within the CDA included, Bristo Square, George Square, Chambers Street, the Student Amenity, The Medical School Extension, the Physical Education Building, Old College and Buccleuch Place. As part of their work, the planning consultants acquired any material thought to be relevant, including plans for proposed University buildings, plans and alteration schemes for existing University buildings and copies of development plans by any other party pertaining to the Comprehensive Development Area.', "The site at Salisbury Green in Edinburgh was donated to the University of Edinburgh by Sir Donald Pollock in 1943. From 1955 it has been in a more-or-less permanent state of development. From 1949-1976 the University's architect site consultant was Sir William Kininmonth, of Rowand Anderson & Kininmonth.", 'In the early 1950s registration and associateship of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) was obtained through completing an examination in professional practice. In July 1952 notice was given that new regulations would come into effect in November 1952 making practical experience an additional criteria. A number of students were subsequently told that the exams they had completed in March 1952 only made them eligible for registration, despite pre-dating the change in regulations, and appealed to the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) for arbitration.', "Coventry City Architect's Department, under the direction of Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson, undertook experimental public housing schemes during the early 1940s. These included the use of pre-fabricated housing and new construction techniques. As an employee of the department from 1938-1941, Percy Johnson-Marshall was involved in the design of these schemes. He collected photographs and plans of the Canley Estate along with press-clippings, journal articles and the commemorative programme produced for the Estate's official opening.", "Comprehensive Development Areas, a statutory designation under the Town and Country Planning Act (1947) , permitted the local authority to tackle the issue of urban blight, preventing piecemeal uncoordinated development, and directing future development according to a coherent plan. In order to achieve Comprehensive development Area designation, local authority town planners were required to provide evidence for consideration by the relevant government ministry, initially the Ministry of Reconstruction, then, after 1946, the Ministry of Town and Country Planning and the Ministry of Housing, which would then make a Declaratory Order. Eight Comprehensive Development Areas were included in the Administrative County of London Development Plan (1951) : City of London; Stepney/Poplar; Bermondsey; South Bank; Elephant and Castle; Bunhill Fields; Lewisham Clock Tower; Woolwich, St Mary's. The scheme was broken down into the individual development areas for detailed implementation. An overview was also required, and files and plans relating to the whole Comprehensive Development Areas Project were also created.", "Percy Johnson-Marshall collected copies of Keystone - the Journal of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants. This was renamed Keystone - the Journal of the Association of Building Technicians when the Association's name changed in 1942. He did not keep full runs of the Journal and only a number of copies are held in the collection.", 'London County Council Architect\'s Department organised many local exhibitions explaining to the public exactly the implications of reconstruction or comprehensive development for their neighbourhoods, with models, plans and photographs. The 1951 Festival of Britain resulted in a large temporary exhibition on London\'s South Bank and a "Live Architecture" exhibition, at Lansbury, London, which was part of the Stepney / Poplar Comprehensive Development Area in the East End. This demonstrated a completely planned neighbourhood, with houses, shops, schools and a market.', 'Some of the work undertaken by Percy Johnson-Marshall, while he was a student at the University of Liverpool, was undated. This means it is impossible to identify which course or year group the work belonged to. The source of the projects below could not be identified.', "Percy Edwin Alan Johnson-Marshall (1915-1993) was one of the most energetic of a generation of town-planners who began their careers in the 1930s and, after the Second World War, dedicated their lives to the creation of a new world of social equity through the radical transformation of the human environment. Born in Ajmer, India, he was brought by his parents, via the Middle East, to England in the 1920s. In 1931 Percy followed his brother Stirrat Johnson-Marshall to the School of Architecture at the University of Liverpool. Here he studied under the two most eminent professors of the period, Sir Charles Herbert Reilly and Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie. After gaining the Diploma in Architecture (with distinction), in 1936, Johnson-Marshall entered public service as assistant architect, first for Middlesex County Council, then for Willesden Borough Council (1936-1938). In the meantime he had taken a postgraduate certificate in Civic Design, at the University of Liverpool Department of Civic Design. In 1938 Coventry City Council created its new City Architect's Department, appointing the highly respected Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson, later Sir Donald, as Chief Architect. Johnson-Marshall was hired by Gibson and given the post of Senior Assistant Architect in charge of redesigning the obsolete city-centre, in 1939. The design of the new civic centre was given added impetus when Coventry was devastated in a bombing raid in November 1940. Johnson-Marshall was called-up for military service in 1941 and, after basic training in England, saw service with the Royal Engineers in India and Burma. During his time in the army, he lost his first wife in Coventry and met and married his second wife in India. He was also actively involved in the Service's Architect's Technical Organisation (SATO), leading teaching groups, giving lectures and writing articles on planning. Having achieved the rank of Major, he was attached to the Government of Burma as an advisor on reconstruction and, with William Tatton-Brown, devised a reconstruction plan for the country (1946). After demobilisation, Johnson-Marshall worked as Assistant Regional Planning Officer for the newly created Ministry of Town &mp; Country Planning (1946-1948). During this time he took the intensive completion course, at the School of Planning and Research for Regional Development (SPRRD), in order to gain his Diploma in Town Planning. In 1949 Johnson-Marshall was appointed Senior Planner, in charge of Comprehensive Development Areas to the Architect's Department of the London County Council. He was also a part-time teacher at the SPRRD and, from 1948, Secretary of the School of Planning Club. From 1956 to 1959 he was Group Planning Officer for North-East London before taking up a post as Lecturer in Planning at the newly-created Department of Architecture, at the University of Edinburgh. There he set up the Planning Research Unit, in 1962, which undertook a number of regional surveys for the Scottish Development Department. In 1964, he became Professor of his own Department of Urban Design and Regional Planning. He retired from this post in 1985, becoming the director of the Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies, until his illness in 1987-1988. After Johnson-Marshall was appointed Planning Consultant to the University of Edinburgh, a firm of planning consultants, Percy Johnson-Marshall &mp; Associates, was set up, in 1960. During Johnson-Marshall's lifetime, a number of major commissions were carried out, including regional and sub-regional plans, conservation areas, comprehensive redevelopment areas and residential development plans. During his career, Johnson-Marshall was a member of a number of institutes and involved in numerous other activities. He was elected member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1938 and served as a member of council and of the Education Committee. In 1947 he was elected member of the Royal Town Planning Institute, also serving as a member of council and of the Education Committee. He was a founding member of the International Centre for Regional Planning and Development (ICRPD), in 1954. He was also a member of: the Executive Committee of the Housing Centre Trust, the Society for the Promotion of Urban Renewal (SPUR), and the MARS Group of the Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. He sat on the World Health Organisation's expert panel on Environmental Health and Planning (1970) and was consultant on Human Settlements for the United Nation's Conference on the Human Environment (1972), Chairman of the Royal Town Planning Institute's Town and Country Planning Summer Schools, and, from 1977-1980, Vice President of the International Society of City and Regional Planners (ISoCARP). In 1975, Professor Johnson-Marshall was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), in recognition of his contribution to the planning profession.", "Bunhill Fields suffered 73% bomb damage during World War II and was designated as London County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 6. It is in London's St Luke's area and adjoins the City of London's Barbican area. It had a mixture of commercial, industrial and residential uses. It was divided into three sections: the western part was to be developed by the the Corporation of London, and included the Northampton College of Technology extension, by the London County Council Architect's Department Schools Division and the Golden Lane Housing Scheme in the Borough of Finsbury. The central part, between Golden Lane and Whitecross Street, was sponsored by the Peabody Trust. The eastern part, where many pre-war flats survived, was partially redeveloped for housing.", "The University of Edinburgh's King's Buildings site, to the south of the city, was acquired in 1919 and since then has steadily been developed with buildings for the Faculties of Science and Engineering and some non-University institutes. Percy Johnson-Marshall was appointed site consultant in 1964, coordinating developments, allocating sites for buildings and determining the roads and general layout in a series of reports and feasibility studies. In this, he was responsible to the King's Buildings Committee, itself a sub-committee of the University Development Committee, and the various sub-committees involved with specific buildings, until 1985. During Johnson-Marshall's tenure, buildings by a variety of architects were erected for: Biology, Forestry & Natural Resources (the Darwin Building); Maths, Physics & Computer Science (the James Clerk-Maxwell Building); Botany; the (new) Refectory and Boiler House; Experimental Petrology, and Epigenetics. Many existing buildings were also extended and Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates were the architects for the system-build multi-storey car park.", "The Reconstruction Areas Group (RAG) was part of the Town Planning Division within the London County Council Architect's Department. This was set up in 1949 to deal with bomb-damaged areas using powers created under the Town and Country Planning Act (1944) . The designation of such areas allowed London County Council to purchase property to facilitate reconstruction, subject to the approval of the Minister for Reconstruction. In 1956 the Town Planning Division was reorganised into three divisions, North-West, North-East and South. Percy Johnson-Marshall was put in charge of the North-East division, which included Stepney/Poplar and Bunhill Fields, replacing the RAG. The Housing Division, consisting of architects and technicians, was responsible for the design and construction of a substantial number of the dwellings that were built by the Housing Department of London County Council. It also had some input into the design and layout of London County Council housing contracts undertaken by private architects. Development in London was carried out according to the principles contained in the County of London Development Plan. Such statutory development plans are subjected to constant review based on the progress of the current plan. The Town Planning Division of the LCC Architect's Department was required to provide statements on policy and progress to facilitate revision of the County of London Development Plan. The 1943 plan was revised in 1951 and 1955. Public Inquiries played a role in the planning process, taking place prior to national government decisions on the approval of development plan reviews, the designation of Comprehensive Development Areas and Reconstruction Areas, as well as in the event of appeals by developers against decisions made by the local planning authority. In London the Architect's Department was required to provide proofs of evidence for consideration by the reporters to the public inquiries. Open Space Deficiency was one of the problems identified in the County Of London Plan (1943, 1951 and 1955) and the Town Planning Division of London County Council Architect's Department attempted to address this issue by allocating open spaces at agreed standards, on a neighbourhood basis, in its development schemes. In London residential areas this was 4 acres per 1000 persons.", "Under the Town and Country Planning Act (1947) Comprehensive Development Areas (CDAs), proposed by a local authority and approved by the Secretary of State, allowed land and property to be acquired, for broad planning purposes, using compulsory purchase orders, if necessary. The Administrative County of London Development Plan, (1951) , identified 100 areas in need of comprehensive development but it was only feasible to designate eight CDAs: City of London, Stepney / Poplar, Bermondsey, South Bank, Elephant and Castle, Bunhill Fields, Lewisham Clock Tower and Woolwich. The Reconstruction Areas Group (RAG), with Percy Johnson-Marshall as senior planner, was set up within the Planning Division of the London County Council's Architects Department to administer the CDAs, in 1949. Work continued in some CDAs after the Planning Division was reorganised in 1956, with Percy Johnson-Marshall overseeing those which fell within the jurisdiction of the North East Group.", 'Percy Johnson-Marshall remained at the University of Liverpool to study for the Certificate in Civic Design, after completing his Diploma in Architecture at the Liverpool School of Architecture. Some of the assignments undertaken for the certificate have survived, including his final thesis project for a proposed town planning scheme for the town of March.', "Sociological reports provided essential material and data for planning any neighbourhood. These would include information about the community, their housing, occupations and places of work, membership of churches and clubs etc. London County Council Architect's Department had its own sociologist, Margaret Willis and often also consulted Dr Ruth Glass and John Westergaard of the Association for Planning and Regional Reconstruction. Willis produced a number of reports including: Play Areas (1951) , Living in High Flats (1951) , Maisonettes (1952) .", 'The Association of Building Technicians was founded in 1919 as the Architects\' and Surveyors\' Assistants\' Professional Union. In 1924 it became the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA). It changed name again in 1942 to become the Association of Building Technicians (ABT). During his early working life Percy Johnson-Marshall was an active member of the Association. He held office on a number of central and regional committees. Work on these included overseeing the authorship of reports and representing students in professional disputes. He was also one of the organisers of the "Coventry of Tomorrow Exhibition" mounted by the Coventry Branch of the AASTA in 1940. During the course of his membership, Johnson-Marshall also collected a selection of published material produced by the association.', "Woolwich, the most easterly of London's Boroughs south of the River Thames, had an area of 63 acres of land bombed during World War II, and obsolescent property in and around the docks at St Mary's. This was designated by London County Council as Comprehensive Development Area no 8.", "The Walter Ramsay Architects won the prize competition for the University of Edinburgh Medical Extension for the entire north side of George Square in 1951. Work on the first phase, for pathology, commenced in 1956, to a design amended by Sir Basil Urwin Spence. The second phase, pharmacology, was built during 1968-1970. There was considerable delay before work commenced on the third phase in 1976. This was to house biochemistry and the medical library, with John Hardie Glover designing the library within Ramsay's building. The third phase, was completed in 1978, and named, the Hugh Robson Building after the former University Vice-chancellor who died in 1977, and Erskine Medical Library. Plans for further phases were shelved and the former George Watson's Ladies' College, which occupied the remainder of north George Square, was instead converted for the use of the Department of Psychology by Spence, Glover & Ferguson (1977-1978).", "Percy Johnson-Marshall and Associates was founded, in 1962, by Percy Johnson-Marshall as a Planning Consultancy, initially on the strength of his appointment as Planning Consultant to the University of Edinburgh for its Comprehensive Development Areas. The company was originally based in outbuildings at Johnson-Marshall's house, Bella Vista, Duddingston, Edinburgh. The company specialised in Urban Design and Regional Plans, with very few architectural designs before 1980. Regional plans were produced for Porto, Portugal (1973-1975) and, in association with Sir Robert Hogg Matthew for Coleraine, Northern Ireland (1966-1968), and Islamabad (1961). Major redevelopment plans were also produced for Kilmarnock, Sunderland, Newcastle upon Tyne (1968-1971) and Salford (1961-1967). Between 1980 and his retirement in 1985, Johnson-Marshall's input declined, as the company moved towards more conventional architectural work and urban improvements. During this time work began to appear under the name of Johnson-Marshall, Mackie and Hare, and later Percy Johnson-Marshall & Partners (PJMP), with Bruce Hare as principal architect.", "Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a number of resources and administrative files relating to his staff management role, while in charge of the Reconstruction Areas Group, and later the North East Group of the Town Planning Division of London County Council's Architect's Department. Resources comprised internal telephone directories. Administrative files include staffing issues, and the reorganisation of the Division in 1956.", 'While posted with the army in India, during World War II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) from 1943 until his repatriation in 1945. He received reports from, and corresponded with, the regional groups across India and Burma, including modern day Bangladesh and Pakistan. This correspondence was filed according to group and numbered sequentially. The files described in this series are those which have been recovered from the set.', "The various committees and sub-committees of the Association of Building Technicians wrote responses to major reports by other bodies, and reports recommending best practice for the professions which the union represented. As Chairman of the Architects' Professional Advisory Committee (1946-1947) and Secretary to the Planning Committee (1948-1950), Percy Johnson-Marshall was involved in coordinating research and compilation of these reports. A number of manuscript and typewritten drafts have been retained, along with some background research information and accompanying correspondence.", 'Planning consultant to the University of Edinburgh, Percy Johnson-Marshall was frequently asked to produce reports for specific projects, or sites, within the University Comprehensive Development Area (CDA), such as the High School Yards Site (1971) and the Empire Garage site (1977) Feasibility studies were also commissioned by the University from other architects, such as the Buccleuch Church site for which Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall & Partners produced unexecuted schemes in 1971 and 1973. Studies and reports carried out on behalf of other organisations for sites within the CDA were essential material for planning the CDA.', 'The main building of the University of Edinburgh is Old College built during the 18th and 19th centuries to designs by Robert Adam and William Henry Playfair. Since then there have been successive works to repair, alter and convert its accommodation and upgrade the quadrangle. In the late 1940s, R Gordon Brown produced an unexecuted scheme, as did Ian G Lindsay & partners, in the mid-1960s. Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates produced reports on its rehabilitation in 1976-1977.', 'South East South London borough of Lewisham, adjoining Bermondsey, was a highly mixed area with the River Thames in the north, dense urban fabric in the centre and leafy suburbs to the south. As a result of its town centre being devastated by a flying bomb in 1944, a 40 acre Comprehensive Development Area was designated by London County Council at Lewisham Clock Tower.', "Chambers Street, Edinburgh, is dominated by the University of Edinburgh's 18th century Old College building and the Royal Scottish Museum, on its south side. The street was included in the University of Edinburgh/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area on its northern boundary. Chambers Street, together with the adjacent George IV Bridge, featured in several feasibility studies in the 1970s as the government sought to extend both the Museum and the National Library of Scotland (NLS). The Ministry of Public Buildings and Works produced an unexecuted scheme to extend the Museum in 1970, with another drafted by the Department of the Environment, in 1973. A competition-winning design for the Museum extension, by Benson & Forsyth, was finally completed in 2000. The removal of Heriot-Watt University to a new campus left its old Chambers Street building vacant. It was first considered for use by the University of Edinburgh and then by the NLS, with a feasibility study produced by the Department of the Environment and Plowman, Craven & Associates (1973) before it was ultimately taken over by the Crown Office as its headquarters. The NLS extension was finally built behind the existing building (1999-2001). Since 1926 the University has occupied Minto House, which is flanked by the Heriot-Watt building and an entrance to the Argyll Brewery site. The University of Edinburgh acquired the brewery in 1972 and Ian G Lindsay & Partners undertook feasibility studies. In 1975, the Departments of Architecture, Urban Design & Regional Planning and Landscape Architecture moved into premises comprising Minto House and the brewery maltings, which had been converted for the purpose by Ian G Lindsay & Partners. Another part of the brewery site, in the Cowgate, was redeveloped for student accommodation in the 1990s, and the ancient Tailor's Hall sold to a private developer.", 'The University of Edinburgh has operated from a variety of sites for many years and all of these have been subject to development of varying scale throughout the 20th century, all under the authority of the University Court. While these sites were developed as individual architectural entities, they were all part of the development of an ever-expanding University and were complementary to each other. For example, academic development that would allow an increase in students was directly related to the development of halls of residence and student amenities. Statistics were vital in coordinating the great expansion of the mid-20th century. Displacement and decanting of university personnel during development was a complex matter that relied upon accurate information derived from site use surveys. The financial costs and forecasts had to be viewed in a University-wide context, as well as a site-specific one. Development accounts had to be carefully balanced, as most capital expenditure was funded by the Government through the University Grants Committee. In order to keep the public and University staff informed about development proposals, Percy Johnson-Marshall organised a standing exhibition, "An Expanding University" at Adam House, Chambers Street, which lasted from 1963-1973. For students and staff, understanding of, and movement between, University sites, was explained by a continuing series of published maps.', "Percy Johnson-Marshall retained an interest in the continued redevelopment of Coventry long after he ceased to be a member of the City Architect's Department's staff in 1941. At some point he acquired a number of internal reports from the renamed Coventry City Architectural and Planning Department, where Arthur Ling was now the City Architect and Planning Officer. He also collected a number of plans relating to the redevelopment of Coventry, produced by the same department, which both pre-dated and post-dated his period of employment there between 1938-1941. This material was probably collected as background research for his book Rebuilding Cities ( 1966)", "The City of Edinburgh's elected representative body, from 1900-1975 was the City of Edinburgh Corporation. This was succeeded in 1975 by Edinburgh District Council. In Scotland, decisions are, for the most part, delegated to specialist committees, which perform as sub-committees to the Full Council. This enables detailed consideration of complicated matters, which the Full Council would not have time to examine closely. Committee decisions have to be ratified by the Full Council. In addition working parties, consisting of non-elected experts and Council officials are frequently set up to report to the Council with advice on important but complicated issues. One such working party, the City of Edinburgh Working Party on Major Highway Planning (1963-1983), gathered information and formulated proposals concerning the city's, seemingly intractable roads problems. The governing body of the University of Edinburgh is the University Court. Sub-committees of the Court are created to take responsibility for investigating and making recommendations to the Court on time-consuming issues. The Development Committee, constituted in 1954, as successor to the Post-war Development Committee, had responsibility for the physical development of the University. The Works and Buildings Committee was constituted in 1965, as a successor to the Major Buildings Committee, and had responsibility for individual building projects, dealing directly with the architects and user-group sub-committees.", 'Prior to bombing during World War II, the adjacent boroughs of Stepney and Poplar, in London\'s East End, had suffered from urban blight in the forms of overcrowding, obsolescent buildings and lack of open space. 2000 acres were designated as a Comprehensive Development Area no 2 by London County Council. This was replanned as a series of eleven neighbourhoods in 1948-1949. Residential density was set at 136 persons per acre, for a planned population of 100,000 in total. Each neighbourhood had its own community, educational and shopping facilities. Industry was zoned along the canal and by the docks, a new road pattern established and large new public open spaces laid out. Neighbourhoods included Lansbury, which featured in the "Live Architecture" Exhibition, as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951, and the completely new neighbourhood of St Anne\'s, at Limehouse.', 'Despite protests to the War Office by Coventry City Architect, Donald Gibson, Percy Johnson-Marshall was drafted, for active service in World War II, in 1941. After basic training in England, during which time he gave lectures on planning to comrades, he was assigned to the Royal Engineers and posted to India, in 1942, with a commission as Captain, later promoted to Major. In India, Johnson-Marshall became General Secretary of the Service Architects\' Organisation (SAO), later renamed the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO), and was extremely active promoting the cause of city and regional planning and reconstruction. This was done through a series of lectures to servicemen and Indian organisations, such as the Indian Institute of Engineers (Bengal) as well as articles for journals, such as the Journal of the Indian Institute of Architects, and radio broadcasts for All-India Radio, in Calcutta. In addition, as a response to the lack of training for effective reconstruction, he prepared a memorandum for the Viceroy\'s Executive Council, Proposed faculties of planning, design and technics for India (1944). Most of his Indian output was included in a private press booklet Introduction to Planning (1944). Following the cessation of hostilities, Johnson-Marshall and William Tatton-Brown were seconded to the Government of Burma as advisors on planning and reconstruction. They submitted in three reports as A National Plan for Burma (1946). This was also outlined in an All-India Radio broadcast "The Burma Scene" (1946) and an article in the Architects\' Journal (May 1946).', "After completing his Diploma in Architecture at the University of Liverpool, Percy Johnson-Marshall was employed as Assistant Architect by Willesden Borough Council from 1936-1938, where his brother Stirrat was already employed. He worked on municipal architectural projects as part of the team under the borough engineers F Wilkinson and his successor F Wayman Brown. These included school alterations, public housing estates, a refuse disposal plant and the electricity showroom on Willesden Lane. Johnson-Marshall also worked on the design for the Willesden Cemetery superintendent's house, and it is possible that he was the main architect for this.", "Percy Johnson-Marshall was employed in Coventry City Architect's Department, as a member of Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson's team, from 1938-1941. During this time he collected papers, photographs, press-clippings and plans relating to the work being undertaken on the civic centre. Initially these were plans for comprehensive redevelopment. Following the civic centre's destruction in a World War II bombing raid, on 14 November 1940, plans for reconstruction were developed. Johnson-Marshall also collected material relating to the innovative public housing projects which were undertaken during his period of employment with Coventry City Council. One document survives concerning Johnson-Marshall employment record. This is a letter from Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson asking Lord Reith to release him from active service in India and Burma, as Gibson felt his skills would be better utilised in the reconstruction work being undertaken in Coventry.", "From 1962, Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates were consulted on alterations, improvements and extensions to the University of Edinburgh's playing fields at Peffermill, to the south of the city.", "244 acres in the City of London were considered suitable for Comprehensive Development, at Tower Hill, the Barbican and St Paul's Cathedral, and were designated as Comprehensive Development Area no 1 by London County Council. The Barbican was under the jurisdiction of the Corporation of London. They commissioned Charles Henry Holden and Sir William Graham Holford in 1947 as planning consultants for a reconstruction plan intended for private development. A joint London County Council/ Corporation of London basic scheme, involving pedestrian/traffic segregation was produced in 1949 and revised in 1954. A proposed development by the New Barbican Committee, an architects' consortium, was put forward in 1954, with Kadleigh, Horsburgh & Whitfield, as architects. This was rejected after a planning appeal. The Corporation of London commissioned its Golden Lane housing development from Chamberlin, Powell & Bon (although the site was actually in Finsbury). The St Paul's precinct was proposed in the Holford and Holden City of London Plan,1947, but re-planned by Holford, in consultation with the Ministry of Housing and the chairmen of London County Council and the Corporation of London. This design included a forecourt to the Cathedral and a commercial area with a decking system. The Tower of London Comprehensive Development Area was an area of urban blight with much war damage. The scheme attempted to create a suitable setting for the historic Tower. Partly in the City and partly in Stepney, this was a collaboration between the Corporation of London and the London County Council Planning Division North-East Group, under Percy Johnson-Marshall. The London County Council team leader was Walter Bor.", "With the exception of the Pollock Halls of Residence, Percy Johnson-Marshall was the planning consultant for all the University of Edinburgh sites. These included: George Square, Bristo Street and Potterrow, Old College, the High School Yards, King's Buildings, Old College and Peffer Mill Playing Fields.", 'The Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) was a voluntary organisation, which started life in Calcutta in 1943, during World War II, as the Service Architect\'s Organization (SAO). This group of British allied service men and women with architectural and planning backgrounds held technical meetings and produced a syllabus for a School of Indian Architecture and Regional Planning, in conjunction with Sris Chandra Chatterjee who had been campaigning for the formation of a school for twenty years. This was adopted as a faculty by the University of Calcutta. The group then went on to form the Service Arts Club, a forum for general arts discussion and education for servicemen and women in India. This met at Bengal Government School of Art. Groups formed in other Indian and Burmese cities under the umbrella of the Service Architect\'s Organization. These groups also had civilian members and held exhibitions, lectures, discussion groups, gave educational advice and undertook small architectural projects. They proposed a full education programme, part of which was supervising distance learning candidates in SE Asia for the London School of Planning and Research for Regional Development course in Town and Country Planning. Plans to develop cultural and educational centres at military bases were presented along with the new name - Service Arts and Technical Organization - in January 1945. By this time the organisation was spread throughout SE Asia, with over twenty regional groups which established their own sections and societies in accordance with the artistic interests of their members. The following were the published aims; 1. to build up a service organization of all those technically concerned with planning, building and engineering reconstruction, and to represent their views 2. to develop and assist cultural and scientific planning activities 3. to form clubs and groups and educational and cultural centres for the purpose of holding exhibitions, discussions, lectures etc, to keep libraries and to organise service "Technical Colleges" 4. to assist in the education of students 5. to assist services welfare and education and to give talks to Reconstruction and Planning Units to educate the public concerning possibilities and the use of experts 6. to keep members in touch with current events, especially professional matters concerning technical personnel for reconstruction By September 1945, under the leadership of the General Secretary, Percy Johnson-Marshall, the organisation moved away from general arts endeavours and cited its first priority as an information provider concerning "resettlement and reconstruction". With this in mind "propaganda" concerning this was made available, along with the establishment of a programme of technical education for troops. Attempts to give the organisation official educational status within the British Army were supported by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) and the Association for Planning and Regional Reconstruction (APRR) who formed a Joint Committee and unsuccessfully approached the War Office. Regardless, Percy Johnson-Marshall set-up an experimental "tech" of 80 students, and coordinated education for the group. This included efforts to ensure that troops had access to distance learning courses whose exams were ratified by relevant professional bodies in Britain. SATO also addressed technical education for Indian and Burmese nationals and this was exemplified by the opening of the SATO Polytechnic in Rangoon on 12 November 1945. Having finally been given official sanction the polytechnic operated both in-college and distance learning courses and provided access to text books, public lectures and touring exhibitions. Percy Johnson-Marshall ceased being the general secretary in November 1945. He was repatriated in May 1946. Shortly afterwards SATO ceased to exist with the gradual repatriation of the organisation\'s active members.', 'London County Council was the principal local government body for Greater London, an elected assembly with responsibility for the 28 metropolitan boroughs from 1887-1965. Borough services included street cleaning, lighting, libraries and rates collection, while the County was responsible for education, ambulances, fire brigades and sewage. Both County and Boroughs were responsible for public housing. The Boroughs could not grant planning consent and although the City of London had its own Corporation, London County Council was the relevant planning authority from 1947.', "Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, a street of Georgian Tenements, lies immediately to the south of George Square and therefore became part of the University of Edinburgh's various redevelopment schemes. Property was acquired there in the 1950s and 1960s in anticipation of demolition - Percy Johnson-Marshall's Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) scheme envisaged the Arts Faculty buildings extending into Buccleuch Place during later phases of development. One block was demolished in 1959-1960 to make way for the first phase of the Arts Faculty Buildings. Other properties were converted into temporary University accommodation or were used to house tenants displaced by other developments in the area. With the abandonment of the CDA plan (1975) and the statutory listing of the surviving buildings, Buccleuch Street remains largely in University use.", "The International Centre for Regional Planning and Development (ICRPD) was conceived at a joint symposium held in London in 1953, organised by the School of Planning and Research for Regional Development, the School of Planning Club and Community Development Projects Ltd. At the symposium it was agreed that a centre for research and education, which would provide an information service and a meeting place, was required to enable closer contacts between the professions concerned with regional planning and development. A preparatory Committee was elected, which went on to organise the International Conference on Regional Planning and Development held at Bedford College, London in 1955. At this conference the resolution was passed to investigate setting up such a centre. GE Janson-Smith from the United Kingdom was elected chair of the international Provisional Committee charged with the investigation. Percy Johnson-Marshall was elected one of the British members. This Committee, through a number of meetings, developed a constitution for the proposed centre, which was finally approved in November 1957. An International Seminar, which studied the history and concepts of regional planning, was held in The Hague, by the Netherlands Universities Foundation for International Cooperation, on behalf of the ICRPD in July 1958. At this conference practical goals and membership criteria of the ICRPD were established, the focus having moved from the establishment of a physical centre to a dispersed programme of professional support and international collaboration. The ICRPD would aim to: document and diffuse information, undertake research, hold meetings, educate, create a register of experts and consultants and undertake public relations. In 1958 the ICRPD exhibited at the World Exhibition in Brussels. International relations began to sour when it became apparent that a lack of financial support from the United Kingdom government, amongst accusations of communist sympathies, meant that the centre of activities would likely be established in the Netherlands. At this stage the British Group of the ICRPD, chaired by Robert Joseph Gardner-Medwin became more active. It had its own General Council, on which Percy Johnson-Marshall sat, and arranged study days for its members. These included the titles 'Economic forces leading to urban concentration' and 'Urbanisation in the tropics - its causes and methods of control'. Plans for an ICRPD Conference in Rhodes in April 1963 were strongly contested by the British Group, leading to the resignation of the president Leo Brandt.", 'Percy Johnson-Marshall was employed by Coventry City Council in the Coventry City Architect\'s Department between 1938-1941. During his employment the City Architect was Sir Donald Evelyn Edward Gibson. Gibson was an innovative architect and town planner who embraced a project planning comprehensive redevelopment of the civic centre. These plans became reality after the destruction of the city\'s historic centre during a World War II bombing raid on 14 November 1940 left the city centre destroyed. Gibson was also interested in social housing and undertook some of the earliest use of prefabricated housing and other innovative construction techniques. Johnson-Marshall was an enthusiastic and valued member of Gibson\'s team. He participated in the construction of the first model for the redevelopment of the Civic Centre during his spare time. He was also one of the organisers of the "Coventry of Tomorrow Exhibition" mounted by the Coventry Branch of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA) in 1940, which show cased Gibson\'s ideas. When Johnson-Marshall was called up for active service in World War II Gibson made appeals for him to be repatriated to rejoin his team. Johnson-Marshall\'s period of employment with Coventry City Council had a profound effect on his later career, introducing him to the reality of planning for reconstruction and comprehensive redevelopment. He later used materials he collected both during and after his employment as the basis of a chapter of his book addressing these topics, Rebuilding Cities ( 1966) .', "The University of Edinburgh's post-World War II development was centered on George Square, originally a Georgian residential square with a large central garden. Development had already commenced on the Medical School Extension (1956) and the Faculty of Arts phase one, according to the Sir Basil Urwin Spence layout of 1955, when Percy Johnson-Marshall was appointed Planning Consultant. Johnson-Marshall was not the architect of any of the George Square buildings but took responsibility for the overall layout, designation of sites, harmonisation of finishes, landscaping and external works. The second phase of the Arts Faculty Buildings (1967), the Main Library (1967), two further phases of the Medical School extension (1970 and 1978) and the first phase of the First-Year Science buildings (1966) were completed during Johnson-Marshall's tenure.", 'While posted with the British Army in India, during World War II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) from 1943 until his repatriation in 1945. One of his duties was liaison with other appropriate bodies such as the Association of Building Technicians and the School of Planning and Research for Regional Development. He also liaised with army personnel posted in other world regions who were either affiliated or considering setting up affiliation organisations to SATO', "As an undergraduate, Percy Johnson-Marshall studied for the Diploma in Architecture at the Liverpool School of Architecture, at the University of Liverpool, from 1931-1936. A large number of Percy Johnson-Marshall's complete assignments, from every year of his Diploma studies, have been carefully preserved", 'Percy Johnson-Marshall studied at the Liverpool School of Architecture at the University of Liverpool, where his brother Stirrat Johnson-Marshall was already a student, from 1931-1938. He initially completed a Diploma in Architecture and afterwards the Certificate in Civic Design. While a student Johnson-Marshall studied under a number of brilliant professorships. When he started his studies, the professor of architecture was Sir Charles Herbert Reilly who was followed by Lionel Bailey Budden in 1933. Meanwhile Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie was the professor of civic design until 1935 and it is likely that Johnson-Marshall studied under him. Johnson-Marshall was a very able student, and during his time in Liverpool he won a number of awards, including the John Lewis Partnership Prize, 1936 and the HW Williams Prize for the Promotion of Architectural Design in Concrete, also in 1936. His education at the University of Liverpool had a lasting influence over both his style and future career. After leaving the University, Percy Johnson-Marshall, along with other former students, instigated the formation of the Liverpool School of Architecture Society, a club for former students. After a successful inauguration dinner, this appears to have had a short life.', "Parking facilities at the University of Edinburgh's various sites were centrally controlled and frequently reviewed by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates.", 'The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London was set up in 1957 "to examine the present system and working of local government in the Greater London area", reporting in 1960 with recommendations that led to the abolition of London County Council and the setting up of the Greater London Council in 1965. During the inquiry, information and evidence was collected from all the departments of London County Council and the 28 Metropolitan Boroughs, with specialist evidence sought from professional bodies in all the relevant fields of expertise. London County Council\'s Architect\'s Department provided evidence on its own organisation and working practices, while the Royal Town Planning Institute gave evidence on the effectiveness of the Architect\'s Department, as well as on the operation of all the Council committees involved in the overall planning process.', "The principles and guidelines for city development were contained in various manuals and handbooks. London County Council Architect's Department produced a number of manuals of its own, pertaining to planning, building controls, traffic congestion and internal protocols. Meanwhile the Ministry of Town and Country Planning produced important guidelines, such as its Handbook, The Redevelopment of Central Areas (1947) , which outlined the correct sequence of survey and development and the rules of development, in terms of daylighting control and plot ratio. Circulars were produced by Her Majesty's Stationary Office relating to both the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 and Town and Country Planning Act, 1959, which were circulated around the London County Council's Architect's Department.", "Bristo Square was conceived in Percy Johnson-Marshall's 1962 Comprehensive Development Area plan as a new civic square enclosed by Student Amenity buildings and the University of Edinburgh's Victorian graduation hall. This new square was to replace the old Bristo Street and its plan depended upon the re-alignment of Potterrow and Lothian Street by Lothian Regional Council. In 1979, a design by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates, with Jamieson, MacKay & Partners as consulting engineers was approved. Following the re-alignment of the road, work on the square was completed in 1982.", 'While employed by Willesden Borough Council Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a few photographs of buildings, which the council designed, both during and after construction.', "A site for the University of Edinburgh Student Amenity Centre was allocated between Marshall Street and Lothian Street, in 1943. Layouts were proposed in the Charles Henry Holden Scheme (1947) and the Sir Basil Urwin Spence Scheme (1955). Percy Johnson-Marshall's plan (1962-1982) arranged the student buildings to the north and east of his planned new Bristo Square. Morris & Steedman were appointed architects for the Amenity Centre in 1962, with work commencing in 1967. The first phase (Refectory and Health Centre) was completed in 1969 and the second (including Bank, Shops and Chaplaincy Centre) in 1976. Two further phases were cancelled.", "In the course of his role as planning consultant to the University of Edinburgh, Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a range of associated printed material, to enable him to understand the wider context within which he worked. Some of these related to the wider planning issues in Edinburgh, and the City Council's reports concerning these. He also collected press-clippings and journal articles concerning the University of Edinburgh Comprehensive Development Area and information concerning the history and development of the areas surrounding the University.", 'In 1965, when the University of Edinburgh Development Committee was reconstituted, the Major Buildings Committee and the former Works Committee were dissolved and the new Works and Buildings Committee came into being. This Committee had control of all buildings, whether planned or existing, and liaised directly with the architects and user-group sub-committees, while a Minor Buildings Sub-Committee dealt with works under £5,000. Percy Johnson-Marshall reported to this committee in terms of his overall master plans, matters of general layout and coordination of external works etc.', "London County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 4: South Bank comprises: the area of the Thames riverbank between Vauxhall and Southwark Bridges in 5 sectors: Albert Embankment; St Thomas's Hospital Precinct; the Permanent Development Area, including County Hall; the area between Waterloo and Blackfriars Bridges; and the area between Blackfriars and Southwark Bridges (Bankside). The Permanent Development Area, designed in 1949 included the temporary exhibition site that was used during the Festival of Britain (1951) The first of the permanent buildings was the Royal Festival Hall, by the London County Council Architect's Department (1951). The scheme was further amended in 1953 and 1957, during which time there were negotiations concerning proposed developments by Shell, Decca Records and the British European Airways. Later, Sir Robert Hogg Matthew was consultant architect for a proposed development by Acquila Investments, in 1960. The National Film Theatre, designed by Denys Lasdun, was opened in 1967.", "Percy Johnson-Marshall took up his first university teaching position as Senior Lecturer in Planning at the University of Edinburgh's new Department of Architecture, in 1959. He taught Civic Design to architecture undergraduates and a postgraduate diploma course in Civic Design. In 1963 he began a course in Regional Planning and, the following year, became Professor of Urban Design and Regional Planning. Later he headed his own Department of Urban Design and Regional Planning, within Sir Robert Hogg Matthew's School of the Built Environment (1966-1967). Post-doctorial fellowships and postgraduate research were available within the Planning Research Unit (PRU), which Johnson-Marshall set up in 1959. The PRU, was independently funded and undertook research for a variety of governmental organisations including the Scottish Development Department. The Architecture Research Unit (ARU), formerly the Housing Research Unit, was set up by Sir Robert Hogg Matthew in 1959 and undertook research and design projects for various local authorities. There was also the opportunity for postgraduate research under its auspices. Johnson-Marshall deputised for Matthew as director of the ARU while the latter was engaged with duties for the Royal Institute for British Architects and International Union of Architects. In 1985, the Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies was opened under the directorship of Percy Johnson-Marshall. This was in the Outlook Tower, the symbolic headquarters of Sir Patrick Geddes, which the University of Edinburgh had acquired. He retired from the post in 1991.", 'London County Council accepted the axioms of the County of London Plan (1943) by John Henry Forshaw and Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie, in 1945. Thereafter they produced the Administrative County of London Development Plan (1951) . Effectively this was the statutory plan required by the Town and Country Planning Act (1947) . This provided the framework for city development, and its recommendations constituted the assumptions underlying planning decisions. The Plan was subjected to reviews, and in this respect proposals were collected and advanced for consideration. The Minister of Town and Country Planning approved the revised Plan in 1955, with the next review following in 1960.', "The planned Edinburgh Eastern Link Road threatened the University of Edinburgh's Physical Education building at the Pleasance and a site for a replacement was allocated between Marshall Street and Crichton Street. By 1973, this site was being considered for a number of uses and another site for the Physical Education building was allocated on the east side of Potterrow, on the site of the old the Empire Garage (1977). With the cancellation of the Link Road plans, in 1977, this project was abandoned.", "The London County Council Town Planning Committee was a sub-committee of the full Council, which convened to consider planning applications under the regulations of the Town & Country Planning Act (1947) . In arriving at its decisions, the Committee sought the recommendations of the Town Planning Division of the Architect's Department which in turn gathered opinions from Council officials in its various departments, such as Parks and Roads, as well as from non-Council bodies and statutory undertakers such as the Thames Ports Authority, the Metropolitan Police Service and London Transport. A number of planning sub-committees existed to consider specific aspects of development proposals, with specialist sub-committees to consider: (compliance with) the Development Plan; Areas of High Fire Risk, Redevelopment and Road Improvements, Architectural and Historic Buildings; London Bye Laws; Special Improvements and Developments. Developments, on behalf of London County Council, by its own Architect's Department, were also subject to this process. A decision by the Town Planning Committee was equivalent to a recommendation for approval, or rejection, by the Full Council. The Full Council often considered large or important developments, in the first instance.", 'While employed by Willesden Borough Council Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a few papers relating to contracts and specifications for municipal buildings. He also retained a pamphlet produced to honour the opening of "Electric House" built by Willesden Borough Council and designed by the borough architect F Wilkinson.', 'The University of Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh jointly ran the Edinburgh Dental Hospital and School. Its Chambers Street building (1927) was reconstructed by Rowand Anderson, Kininmonth & Paul in 1953. When the Corporation of the City of Edinburgh refused consent for a site for a new larger building in Lauriston Place, in 1965, Percy Johnson-Marshall was asked to prepare a feasibility study for the only site available, which was between Crichton Street and Marshall Street (1973). This had already been earmarked for Student Amenities, a Physical Education building and buildings for the Science Faculty (Appleton Tower extension). However the Empire Garage site, on Potterrow, was re-allocated for the Physical Education building and designs for the new Dental Hospital were produced by Morris & Steedman (1975-1977). The funding did not materialise and nothing was built, however.', "A Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) was a designation under the Town and Country Planning Act (1947) . This allowed a local authority to acquire property in the designated area, using powers of compulsory purchase in order to replan and develop urban areas suffering from war damage or urban blight. Surveys and feasibility studies were required for a CDA to be considered and approved by the relevant Government Minister. In Scotland, this was the Secretary of State for Scotland. The University of Edinburgh had two CDAs planned. Unusually these were instigated by the University, rather than the local authority, and planned by Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates. The University/Nicolson Street CDA (1962) comprised a large area including that already earmarked for University development. The latter was to be linked to a new commercial zone and a residential area to the east and required collaboration between the University, the Local Authority and private developers. The scheme, however, stagnated and was never approved by the Secretary of State, becoming officially defunct in 1975, with Local Government Reorganisation and the publication of the South Side Local Plan, (formerly intended as the South Side District Plan). The Mound/Lawnmarket CDA was another proposal by Johnson-Marshall that never achieved statutory status. This area consisted of about 8 acres of densely built-up, and fairly ancient property in the Old Town surrounding the headquarters of the University's Faculty of Divinity at New College. The scheme started with the need for renovation of New College and the dire state of some historic buildings adjacent to it (1961). A CDA was proposed in 1967 to enable expansion of the academic buildings and conversion of several old tenements for student accommodation. However, the scheme was scaled down, although Mylne's Court was successfully rehabilitated for residencies and New College restored, by 1970. Ultimately, other properties were found to be not viable for conversion and the CDA proposal was advanced no further. The University operated from a variety of sites: the Central Area, including George Square and Old College; King's Buildings, the location of the Faculties of Science and Engineering; Pollock Halls, the student residences; The Mound/Lawnmarket, including New College; High School Yards, where many historic buildings were converted for University use, between 1905 and 1965. There were also departments operating from individual sites around the city.", 'While posted with the British Army in India, during World War II, Percy Johnson-Marshall was General Secretary to the Service Arts and Technical Organization (SATO) from 1943 until his repatriation in 1945. While he was in post SATO achieved its aim of setting up their own polytechnic to train army personnel in a variety of technical skills. These included aspects of the building trade, to ensure that returning British troops had the required skills to undertake employment in post-war reconstruction. The polytechnic also enrolled army personnel who held Indian or Burmese nationality to improve available skills for local reconstruction. This was run by the 12th Army and based in Burma. Percy Johnson-Marshall kept a number of files concerning the development and opening of the polytechnic as well as the course which it offered.', "The Architect's Department of London County Council was responsible for the development of London according to its own statutory plan. This entailed positive planning as well as controlling or vetting private development. The Department was under the leadership of the Architect to London County Council. Sir Robert Hogg Matthew was the first post-war Chief Architect (1946-1953), succeeded by Sir Leslie Martin (1953-1956) and then Hubert Bennet. It was the largest such local authority organisation in Western Europe, with 3000 staff in 1956. Its design staff undertook a variety of jobs for London County Council departments, such as Housing, Parks, Schools and general civic improvements. From 1946-1949 the Architect's Department was made up of four main divisions: The Housing Division, the Schools Division, the Planning Division and the General Division. The Housing Division was the largest and was itself served by a Housing Engineers Division, Structural Division and Quantities Division. The Schools Division was a smaller group, with much design work contracted out to private architects. It had responsibility for maintenance, however. The Planning Division was arranged into four sub-groups: Information and Research, the Development Plan Group, the Application Group and the Reconstruction Areas Group. Percy Johnson-Marshall was put in charge of the Reconstruction Areas Group when it was set up in 1949. At this time the Planning Division was under the directorship of Arthur Ling. In 1956 these groups were amalgamated into one single Policy Group for North East, North West and South London districts. Percy Johnson-Marshall was in charge of the North East group until 1959. The General Division dealt with anything that was not Schools, Planning or Housing.", "Although Percy Johnson-Marshall was most involved with the Town Planning Committee, there were a number of other London County Council Committees which he consulted the papers of. The Housing Committee formulated the housing policies of London County Council and directed the work of officials in its Housing Department. It had many sub-committees, including the Development and Management Sub-Committee, which dealt with providing new Council housing. This might be designed by the Architect's Department or by private sector architect's, with work carried out either by London County Council direct labour organisation or contracted out to construction firms. There were also London County Council committees for Parks, Roads and Education, which itself had sub-committees for Schools, School Planning, and Further Education.", "The first Statutory City Development Plan of 1949, and its successors, recommended major highway improvements for Edinburgh. Plans were discussed and redrawn over a long period. The Working Party on Major Highway Planning was set up to consider the alternatives and advise the local authority on transport strategy. The Eastern Link Road, from St Leonard's to Calton Hill, was of particular interest to the University of Edinburgh as it occupied property affected by the Link and its feeder roads. Resolution of the Eastern Link Road issue was critical for the finalisation of the layout of the University / Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area. Percy Johnson-Marshall represented the University's interests as expert planner on the Working Party. One of Johnson-Marshall's own proposals was for a new carriageway through the Grassmarket for which he commissioned perspectives from Alexander Duncan Bell, in 1963. The Eastern Link Road was abandoned in 1977.", "As well as the areas designated as Comprehensive Development Areas, London County Council Architect's Department had other development areas of importance. These were at the Quadrant Estate, Islington; the Loughborough Estate, Brixton; the Roehampton Estate; the Ackroyden Estate, Putney; the Brandon Estate, Southwark; the Priory at Blackheath and Bethnal Green.", "An area extensively bombed during World War II, the London County Council Comprehensive Development Area no 5: Elephant and Castle centered on a junction of the roads from Westminster and the Waterloo and Blackfriars Bridges. The basic redevelopment design went through various permutations before London County Council built the London College of Printing, designed by the Schools Division of the Architect's Department. In 1951 Percy Johnson-Marshall and Arthur Ling proposed a multi-level intersection and combining the two underground stations. A more modest scheme, with a single level roundabout (1954), was superceded by one involving limited competitions, drafted by Gordon Logie, in 1960. A competition for the design for the commercial development, to be undertaken by private developers, was won by Erno Goldfinger. Messrs Boissevain and Osmond won a second competition, for a shopping centre.", 'For the information of University of Edinburgh staff and the public, Percy Johnson-Marshall organised a standing exhibition of the University\'s many development schemes, entitled "An Expanding University", at the examination halls, Adam House. This included models, maps, plans, drawings and photographs. Alexander Duncan-Bell was responsible for constantly updating the arrangement and layout and the exhibition, which ran from 1963-1973.', 'In the course of his membership of the Association of Building Technicians (ABT) and its forerunner the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants (AASTA), Percy Johnson-Marshall collected a variety of general information such as membership details, membership cards, pamphlets and information on the association\'s activities. He appears to have attended the 1957 conference "Housing the city dweller" and retained both organisational details and copies of the papers presented.', "The University of Edinburgh Development Committee (UDC) was a subcommittee of the University of Edinburgh Court, the governing body of the University. Convened by the Principal, with the University Secretary as secretary, it had responsibility for the physical development of the University. Its job was to translate academic aspirations into plans for buildings, appointing architects, negotiating with the local authority and arranging funding with the University Grants Committee. The UDC itself spawned numerous sub-committees, from time to time, such as the Science Faculty Development Sub-committee and the Conservation Group Sub-committee and other site-specific and building user-groups. As Planning Consultant to the University, Percy Johnson-Marshall received his instructions from the Committee. He provided plans, models, reports and recommendations in respect of his responsibility for the Central Area. This included Bristo Square, George Square, Chambers Street, the Student Amenity Centre, the Medical School Extension, the proposed Dental Hospital, the proposed Physical Education building, Old College and Buccleuch Place; all under the auspices of the University/Nicolson Street Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) scheme. He was also responsible for the Mound/Lawnmarket CDA; incorporating Mylne's Court, as well as the King's Buildings site and Peffer Mill playing fields."
