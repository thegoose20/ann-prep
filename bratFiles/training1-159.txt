Biographical / Historical
"Dr. George Firth was born on 27 February 1901. He was, successively, a scientist, professional singer, teacher, choral and orchestral conductor, lecturer, administrator and author. Access to Tovey's Essays in musical analysis encouraged him to leave his freelance singing career and study for a B.Mus. degree and then the degree of D.Mus. During army service Firth rose to the rank of Major and became Head of the Arts Department at Newbattle Abbey near Edinburgh. In 1955, Firth was awarded the O.B.E. for services to music in Scotland. Dr. George Firth died on 22 May 1983."
