Scope and Contents
"Manuscript, octo, 13pp, at approximately 3300 words, and written neatly. The account of the story of hardship was written in the form of an interview by someone called 'Banns' or 'Barns' with Sally responding in Cumbrian dialect, and at Keswick, 25 February 1835."

Biographical / Historical
'Sally and Mark may have eloped from Keswick to Gretna Green circa 1798. They walked to Scotland via Carlisle. Having then married they had the problem of returning to Keswick and letting their parents know of the marriage. No sooner than they had returned, Mark was called up for the Militia with the result that Sally did not see him for 4 years. They had six children, none of whom survived childhood, and then Mark himself died in 1821 leaving Sally to fend for herself.'
