Biographical / Historical
'It is uncertain where these Law lecture notes were taken - Edinburgh or Glasgow or elsewhere - and it is uncertain who wrote them down. The student may have been John Auld. This name is noted in pencil on one of the volumes. A student John Auld was indeed attending courses at Edinburgh during this period, between 1829 and 1838, taking courses consecutively on Law (1,2, and 3) and Lit. (6).'
