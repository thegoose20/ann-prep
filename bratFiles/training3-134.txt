"Content Description In his 2-part autobiography, James Hutton writes of his upbringing in Perthshire and attendance at George Watson's College. He was the eldest of the four sons of Alexander and Jessie Hutton, and his brothers were Alexander, John and Duncan. University records indicate that Hutton was born at Balnaguard, Little Dunkeld, Perthshire, on 29 May 1887. He attended the local Torwood School between 1892 and 1899, then studied at Dunkeld Royal Grammar, 1899-1903, and thereafter at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, 1903 to 1905.In his autobiography, Hutton writes of the 'hours we spent in school' and how he had 'run the whole gamut from rural school, through to high level city school to University'. Indeed, in 1905 he entered Edinburgh University, studying during the years he was there: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, natural Philosophy, Logic, English, and Ancient Greek History. He graduated with MA Honours (Classics) in 1909. While in Edinburgh he lived in Leith and at Buccleuch Street.Hutton also writes of becoming 'a Class I clerk in the Civil Service in London', and of his 'Civil Service days in Edinburgh'.
