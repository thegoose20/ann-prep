Biographical / Historical
'This manuscript embroidery or needle-work pattern book is based on a sixteenth century pattern which was designed by Lunardo Bergamin and presented to Leonora Vigoleno. The contents are inspired by early pattern books by Tagliente etc., and are similar in design to those of Elisabetta Catanea Parsole (1565-1625), the most famous Italian lace designer and wood engraver of her time.'
