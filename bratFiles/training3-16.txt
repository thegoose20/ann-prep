Biographical / Historical
'The antiquarian bookseller and writer George Frederick Robert Sims was born in Hammersmith on 3 August 1923. He was educated at the John Lyons School in Harrow. He worked briefly in Fleet Street before being called up during the Second World War, serving with the Intelligence Corps. Rather than return to journalism after the war, he went into book-selling, starting his own business (G. F. Sims) in 1948. Earlier, in 1943, he had married Beryl Simcock. In 1952 he moved the business to Peacocks, on the edge of Hurst, Berkshire. He published several collections of his own poems and several novels, and memoirs. He was a collector of rare books and manuscripts and his book-selling was mainly by mail order. George Frederick Robert Sims died in Reading on 4 November 1999.'
