Scope and Contents
"Manuscript volume of pp.492, in neat hand on narrow folio paper with numerous additional blanks. Item is bound in contemporary half calf, gilt bands, lettered in gilt. The volume begins with a detailed 'Table 1st' and 'Table 2nd'. The 'Table 1st' details the age, occupation, symptoms, and state of the different physical functions (vital, natural, animal, and sexual). The 'Table 2nd' details the necessary information for the taking of daily reports, the effects of medicines, the state of former symptoms, any new symptoms, and the state of primitive functions. The 88 surgical reports follow the comprehensive brief of the tables, recording the name, symptoms, initial treatment and daily progress or decline of patients. One particular report records almost three months of treatment for Betty Campbell who 'suffered a most extensive burn over the back, breasts and neck and superior extremities' after her clothes had caught fire. She died 'in great agony' on 28 January 1827 'having been admitted on November 2nd, 1826'."
