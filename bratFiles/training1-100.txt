Biographical / Historical
"In modern terms, a discharge is the act or instrument by which a contract or agreement is ended. A mortgage is discharged if it has been carried out to the full extent originally contemplated or terminated prior to total execution. Discharge also means to release from some legal obligation such as the payment of debts. The act of disposing, is the transferring to the possession of another. It is the parting with, alienation of, or giving up of property. The final settlement of a matter and, with reference to decisions announced by a court, a judge's ruling is commonly referred to as disposition, regardless of level of resolution. In Scots law a feu is a right to the use of land in return for a fixed annual payment. Ownership of a property does not pass to a purchaser until the disposition is registered in the Register of Sasines or Land Register of Scotland."
