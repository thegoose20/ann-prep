Biographical / Historical
"The theologian John Anderson was born in 1668. He was tutor to John, Duke of Argyll and Greenwich. Anderson became Minister of Dumbarton in 1698 and was involved in the battle lines drawn around Episcopacy and Presbyterianism. At the time there was a great deal of worry among the Presbyterian clergy in connection with the use of the English liturgy in Episcopalian congregations. In 1720 he was appointed Minister of the Ramshorn Church (later St. David's) in Glasgow. His published works included A dialogue between a curate and a countryman (1710), The second dialogue between the curate and the countryman respecting the English service (1711), and then The countryman's letter to the curate, wherein, besides an historical view of the English Liturgy, the assertions of Sage, the author of the Fundamental Character of Presbytery, concerning its universal usage in Scotland at the time of the Reformation ... are examined and proved to be false, and also Defence of the Church government, faith, worship, and spirit of the Presbyterians (1714). The Rev. John Anderson died in 1721."
