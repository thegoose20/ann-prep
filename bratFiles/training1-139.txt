Biographical / Historical
'The Tracy family lived at St Margaret, St Stephen, Ipswich in the early 1860s. The heads of the household were John Tracy, born in Rochester, Kent, and Mary Tracy, born in Lambeth, Surrey. According to the 1861 Census, the family was a large one, composed of: Mary C. Tracy, aged 40, a daughter who had been born in Scotland; Nathaniel Tracy, aged 31, a son, born in Lambeth, Surrey; Anthony Tracy, aged 23, a son who was born in Ipswich, Suffolk; Jessie Tracy, aged 22, a daughter, born in Ipswich; Agnes L. Tracy, aged 20, a daughter also born in Ipswich; Joseph W Tracy, aged 18, a son, born in Ipswich; Isabel M. W. Tracy, aged 17, a daughter, born in Ipswich; and Humphrey Tracy, aged 15, another son, also born in Ipswich. Sometime in the early 1860s, sisters Agnes L. Tracy, and Isabel M. W. Tracy, had created a birthday gift of a little hand-written volume - a common-place book perhaps - for their older sister Mary C. Tracy who was in her 40s at the time.'
