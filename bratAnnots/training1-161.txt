Scope and Contents
"This autograph letter signed is dated 22 November 1937, and it was written from 'Seamark', Lloyd Road, Hove, Sussex, and addressed to 'My dear Ballie'. The letter regrets that he 'did not see' Baillie last August but that he he will 'have better luck next year'. He has the hope though that he 'will pay me a visit here some day'. The letter accompanied 'this book' - presumably Nicodemus. A mystery (1937). He suggests that if 'you like it at all you may have a chance of suggesting the play for performance'. He believes that in England 'at least' the religious drama 'has a future'. If Baillie is ever to happen to write to him he asks if 'in one word' he might be told 'what people like yourself think of Dunne's Experiment with Time as a proof of Immortality'."
