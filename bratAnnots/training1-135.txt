Biographical / Historical
"Vladimir Grigoryevich Tretchikoff was born on 26 December 1913 in Petropavlovsk, Russia (now Petropavl in Kazakhstan). His painting of a Chinese Girl (known as 'The Green Lady') had become one of the best known and best selling art prints of the 20th century. He was a self-taught artist painting realistic figures, portraits, still life and animals. In 1973 Tretchikoff published his autobiography, Pigeon's Luck, with Anthony Hocking, an account of his wartime experiences. Vladimir Grigoryevich Tretchikoff died in Capetown, South Africa, on 26 August 2006. In 1973, the Edinburgh department store, Patrick Thomson's Ltd., held an exhibition of his work. Patrick Thomson's - or PT's - was first established in 1889 as a small haberdashery and drapery store in Edinburgh. Located in South Bridge, the store lasted until 1906 when the company relocated to North Bridge. The extra space enabled the company to increase the variety of goods offered. Patrick Thomson Ltd was one of a number of large department stores in Edinburgh which included Maule and Son (later Binns/House of Fraser), R. W. Forsyth, both on Princes Street, J. and R. Allan and Peter Allan on South Bridge, Goldbergs at Tollcross, Parkers on Bristo Street, and Jenners. In the store's sixty departments, PT.'s sold boots and shoes, furniture, carpets, millinery and costumes, drapery and toys. There was a Palm Court restaurant, with views across Edinburgh, and an in-house orchestra. In 1952, the Scottish Drapery Corporation, the owners of the department store since 1926, were acquired by Glasgow-based House of Fraser, but in spite this, the store continued trading as Patrick Thomson Ltd. House of Fraser changed the name of the store to Arnotts in 1976, but the store continued to be referred to as P.T.'s until its closure in 1982. Since 1984 the site has become the Carlton Hotel - 200 rooms, plus conference and event space."
