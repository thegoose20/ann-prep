Biographical / Historical
'In 1938, R. Macgregor M.R.C.V.S. was working in the Veterinary Office, Raub, Pahang, in what was then the Federated Malay States (now Malaysia). Pahang is on the Malayan Peninsula, and agriculture is the main economic activity in Raub today, with fruit growing topping this - principally the cultivation of durians. Most is transported to other cities, especially Kuala Lumpur. Besides fruit, rubber tapping is also carried on. In the 1930s, Macgregor had been writing on the local domestic buffalo - animals which were domesticated essentially for use on uncared for pasture. The buffalo were of two distinct species, or types, one for use on dry ground and the other for use in swamps.'
