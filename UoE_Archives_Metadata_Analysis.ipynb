It is dated 5 December 1622. Henry Cary, an English landowner and politician, son of Sir Edward Cary and grandson of Sir Henry Knevet, master of the jewel office to Queen Elizabeth and King James, was born circa 1575. He entered Gray's Inn in 1590 and Exeter College, Oxford, in 1593, at a young age. Cary served in France and the Low Countries. Cary sat in the House of Commons from 1601 to 1622, and was created Viscount Falkland in the Scottish peerage in 1620. He was appointed to succeed Sir Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison, as Lord Deputy of Ireland. His patent was sealed in March 1622 and he was sworn on 18 September 1622. Cary died in September 1633 after breaking his leg which then had to be amputated. Sir Richard Bolton, an English lawyer, was born circa 1570. He practised for a time as a barrister in England, but left for Ireland with the intention, it has been alleged, of avoiding the results of a censure passed on him by the court of Star-chamber. At the end of 1604 he obtained employment as temporary Recorder of Dublin, and was confirmed in the post in 1605. By the end of 1618 Bolton was appointed Solicitor-general for Ireland, and he became Attorney-General to the Court of Wards at Dublin in 1622, and was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1625. Bolton's son Edward succeeded him as solicitor-general in Ireland in 1622, and as chief baron in 1640. Sir Richard Bolton died in November 1648.\"}, 'processinfo': {'Catalogued by Graeme D.

      "Please note that the 2275 items recorded within this catalogue are a combination of those items identified and catalogued between 1985 and 1998 by staff and volunteers at the former Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies at the Outlook Tower, along with previously uncatalogued material that was also transferred to the University of Edinburgh Special Collections from the former Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies at the Outlook Tower. The new material was uncovered during the 2016-2020 stock-check undertaken as part of the Wellcome Research Resource-funded archive cataloguing project \"Evergreen: Patrick Geddes and the Environment in Equilibrium.\" All of the items recorded within the printed legacy catlaogue (1998) are listed in the new online catalogue (2020) but there are a significant number of individual items or entire series from the legacy catalogue which were not located during the 2016-2020 stock-check. The catalogue descriptions for missing items are included in the new online catalogue for the purposes of audit trail and to allow for items to be easily integrated into the collections catalogue should they be rediscovered at a later date.\n",
