Scope and Contents
"The document is not strictly a charter of foundation. It confirmed and extended a previous charter signed by James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, on 13 March 1567, which had granted the Town of Edinburgh all the lands, buildings, and revenues formerly belonging to the monastic orders abolished during the Scottish Reformation of 1560. These were to be used for the support of the city's clergy and the poor. King James's charter ratified Mary's gift but also authorised the Town Council to spend the income from the former ecclesiastical properties on a college of higher education."

Biographical / Historical
"The University of Edinburgh was established as the 'Tounis College' by a charter of novodamus from King James VI of Scotland in 1582. This gifted old ecclesiastical revenues to the burgh of Edinburgh to be used to establish a college.Empowered by James's charter, the Town Council went on to convert Hamilton House on the site of Kirk o' Field to provide class-rooms, a college hall, and seventeen sleeping chambers for students. On 14 September 1583, they appointed Robert Rollock (1555-1599) as the first Regent of the University. One month later the newly founded university opened its doors to its first students."
