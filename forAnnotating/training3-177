Telephone us on: 0131 650 3392 or email us at lhsa@ed.ac.uk', 'World AIDS Day Organising Committee (Lothian) was an Edinburgh-based organisation set up in November 1999. The aim of the organisation was to advance the education of the public, particularly in relation to World AIDS Day and HIV and AIDS issues.WADOC Lothian committed itself to ensuring World AIDS Day [WAD] was commemorated in Edinburgh on 1st December every year, and to promoting understanding surrounding HIV and AIDS. As part of this, the organisation ensured to provide a WAD indoor event for participants, to display and distribute information on HIV and AIDS services available in the area, organise a candle-lit march to an outdoor location for the placing of candles and standing remembrance, and provide post-vigil hospitality for participants. WADOC was responsible for launching a publicity campaign through the issue of press releases to Scottish media, and publishing and distributing posters and information to various entertainment venues, schools, health centres, libraries, and community centres amongst others, for the purpose of publicising events relevant to WAD. The organisation was responsible for raising sufficient funds to meet the costs of organising and providing the annual WAD events in Edinburgh.WADOC also encouraged other organisations to plan events around WAD, and was able to award small grants to appropriate agencies, groups and individuals for promotion, educational, and the support and care of those people living with HIV in the Lothians.WADOC operated until June 2006, when the dissolution of the organisation became official, after it was felt the charity had served its purpose in promoting and educating the public on the issues surrounding HIV and AIDS.'
