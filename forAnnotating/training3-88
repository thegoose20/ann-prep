Biographical / Historical
"Francesco Barsanti was an Italian flautist, oboist and composer. He was born in 1690 in the Tuscan city of Lucca, and had begun studying law in Padua only to abandon that for music. He spent most of his life in London, moving there in 1714, and from 1735 he also lived in Edinburgh where he obtained a post as a 'Master' with the Edinburgh Musical Society. He also benefitted from the patronage of Lady Charlotte Erskine (1720-1788). Poor finances led him to return to London where his daughter became a successful actress and opera singer. Barsanti was the first of many foreign composers to be captivated by Scottish songs and he dedicated his Collection of Old Scots Tunes to his sometime patron, Lady Erskine. Francesco Barsanti died in 1775."
