Biographical / Historical
'Alan Owen was born in Inverness on 2 September 1922. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy. At the time of starting studies at Edinburgh University in 1939, his family still lived in Inverness. At University he followed classes in English and British History between 1939 and 1940, English and Philosophy from 1940 to 1941, then Latin, Psychology and Geography from 1941 to 1942. War service presumably followed because he did not graduate with the degree of MA until June 1946. Thereafter he was awarded the diploma and degree of Dip.Ed. (1947) and B.Ed. (1948). Anne Hyslop Gemmell was born in Coalburn, Lanarkshire, on 16 June 1923. She was educated at Ormiston Public School and at schools in Wishaw and Cumnock. At the time of her starting studies at Edinburgh University in 1941, her family still lived in Ormiston. At University she followed classes in French, German and Political Economy between 1941 and 1942, French and German during 1942 and 1943, then Psychology, Moral Philosophy and Economic History between 1945 and 1946. She graduated in January 1945, and was awarded a Diploma in Social Study in 1947. Both Alan Owen and Anne Hyslop Gemmell were members and associates of the XIIth International Congress of Pyschology held in Edinburgh at the University of Edinburgh between 23 July and 29 July 1948.'
