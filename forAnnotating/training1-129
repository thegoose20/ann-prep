Scope and Contents
"The bound manuscript volume contains notes on 'Astronomy' and 'Spherical Trigon[ometry]'. There are a number of sketches within the notes."

Biographical / Historical
'This manuscript volume is contemporary with the period in which John Playfair (1748-1819), scientist and mathematician, was a Professor at Edinburgh University. Playfair had become Professor of Mathematics after Dugald Stewart (formerly holding the Mathematics chair) succeeded Adam Ferguson as Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1785. In 1802, he published his Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth, and in 1805 he exchanged the chair of mathematics for that of natural philosophy in succession to John Robison, whom also he succeeded as general secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The notes were probably taken down by a student.'
