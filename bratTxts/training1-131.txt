Biographical / Historical
"Margaret Melville Rae Martin was born in Inverness on 4 March 1941. She was the daughter of Dr. Russell D. and Dr. Margaret Martin, and Dr. Martin was the Medical Officer of Health for Clydebank when he married. Margaret's paternal grandmother was Dr. Emily Winifred Dickson (1866-1944), the first female Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) who married Robert Martin in 1899. She was educated at Inverness Royal Academy, 1946-1956, and then at George Watson's Ladies College, 1956-1959, before studying at Edinburgh University, 1959-1965, and qualifying MB ChB in 1965. Martin enjoyed travelling, fed by an early visit to Poland. So, after training posts in and around Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, during which she collected the Membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1971 and the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, she set off for Ethiopia in 1973. From that year until 1976, she worked in Addis Ababa as a Consultant in the Obstetric and Gynaecology Unit, St. Paul's Hospital, in the city. She was also an Honorary Assistant Professor at the University in Addis Ababa involved in the training of nurses and midwives. On her return to the UK in 1976, after a spell as locum consultant in Paisley, she applied for and was appointed a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Newmarket General Hospital, a post she held until the inpatient unit was closed in 1992. She also held the post of Honorary Obstetrician with Cambridge Health Authority (Teaching). Martin maintained her outpatient clinics at Newmarket until her retirement from the NHS in 2001. Martin became a Fellow of the Royal College of Ostetricians and Gynaecologists in 1985, and she was also a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh). In the last few months of her life Dr. Martin received a Fellowship of the British Medical Association in 2005. Margaret Melville Rae Martin MB ChB FRCS (Edin) died from breast cancer on 22 August 2005. Her funeral was held at Coliston Parish Church in Edinburgh, and a memorial service took place in Woodditton Parish Church near Newmarket in September 2005."
