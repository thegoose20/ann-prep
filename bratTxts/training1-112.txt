Biographical / Historical
"The renowned American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens was born on 1 March 1848 in Dublin. He was raised in New York, though he travelled to Europe for further training and artistic study before returning to the city. He achieved success for his monuments commemorating heroes of the American Civil War, though he also had an interest in numismatics and designed the $20 'double eagle' gold coin for the US Mint in 1905â€“1907. He also designed the $10 'Indian Head' gold eagle coin. Saint-Gaudens created the statue for the Charles Stewart Parnell monument at the top of Dublin's O'Connell Street, which was installed in 1911. His low-relief memorial to Robert Louis Stevenson, who died in Samoa in 1894, can be seen in the Moray Aisle of St. Giles, Edinburgh. The memorial was cast in bronze in 1904. Saint-Gaudens, had been an admirer of Stevenson. Earlier, in Edinburgh on 10 December 1896, at a public meeting presided by Lord Rosebery, it had been decided that it was desirable that steps be taken 'to provide by Public Subscription a memorial in honour' of Robert Louis Stevenson. A first subscription list was published in May 1897, but in spite of wide support for the campaign insufficient money was raised for an open-air memorial. An approach was made to St. Giles for a mural monument. Saint-Gaudens visited Edinburgh in January 1899 to select a site for the memorial in the building and after various delays, it was placed into position in March 1904. Other Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial committee office bearers were Professor Masson, Edinburgh (Chairman), and J. H. Napier, Edinburgh (Secretary)."
