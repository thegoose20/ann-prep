Biographical / Historical
'This unpublished report by Professor Emmett L. Bennett Jr. is of the proceedings of a conference held in Wisconsin in 1961, called the Mycenaean Colloquium. The distinguished Classics scholar, Emmett L. Bennett, born in Minnesota in 1918. Bennett is the founding father of the study of Mycenaean scripts. The focus of his life work was the discovery in 1939 of hundreds of Linear B tablets in Pylos, Greece, by the American archaeologist Carl Blegen (1887-1971) with whom he had worked while earning his Ph.D. at McMicken College of Arts and Sciences, University of Cincinnati. Bennett edited and analysed the primary inscriptions of the pre-alphabetic syllabic script, Linear B, and to do this he used the same skills he had employed as a cryptographer during World War II.'
