Biographical / Historical
"The Scottish Council for African Questions was founded in 1952 at a time when many countries administered by Britain were achieving independence. The Council was a secular body and was not affiliated to any political party. Anyone resident in Scotland or with a Scottish connection was entitled to become a member. The aims of the Council were to strengthen and further the best traditions of Britain's policy in relation to Africa, to promote in Scotland a fuller understanding of the aspirations of the people of Africa, and to promote in Britain policies ensuring the economic and social development and the equitable political rights of all communities in Africa. Honorary Presidents of the Council have been Sir John Boyd-Orr (1880-1971), Nobel Peace Laureate, and Sir Jo Grimond (1913-1993). The Scottish Council for African Questions was wound up on 6 November 1976."
