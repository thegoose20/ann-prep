Biographical / Historical
"1972 was the 500th Anniversary year of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany. The University was founded in 1472 by Louis the Rich, Duke of Bavaria-Landshut. This first Bavarian university was originally sited in Ingolstadt and became finally located in Munich in 1826. Professor N. A. Furness attended the week-long formal celebrations in Bavaria in late June 1972, representing Edinburgh University. At the time, Munich was one of the cities 'twinned' with Edinburgh."
