Biographical / Historical
'Dr. Ian M. MacIntosh was a doctor for the whaling operation of Christian Salvesen Ltd. at Leith Harbour, South Georgia. He served as a 2nd Doctor between 1952 and 1953, and then 1960-1961, and then as sole doctor in 1961-1962 when the whaling station did not operate. His total whaling service was ten seasons. He normally looked after the health of the British whalers while the senior doctor cared for the Norwegians serving with the station. During 1956-1957 period, MacIntosh worked at the Grytviken station on South Georgia at the invitation of the then manager, Ken Pierce Butler who had previously been the Magistrate at King Edward Point, Grytviken. He had been requested to take over responsibility at Grytviken pending the arrival of a new doctor.'
