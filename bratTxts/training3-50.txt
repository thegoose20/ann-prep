Scope and Contents
'This is a collection of 12 very vividly water-coloured drawings (280 x 180 mm) depicting scenes of punishments and executions. They have been done on Chinese rice paper held in place by a light blue silk ribbon border. The binding is covered in contemporary decorated silk. Done probably in Canton (Guangzhou), circa 1850.'

Biographical / Historical
'Chinese watercolours were produced in the port cities of China for sale and export to Western customers in the late-18th and 19th centuries. Subjects covered such subjects as figure drawings, the crafts of tea growing and porcelain-making, topographical views, bird and flower painting, and the slightly more unusual. These had a considerable influence on the estern image of China.'
