Scope and Contents
"The Russian-English ink manuscript glossary takes up only 5 pages of a small ledger. It is entitled in hand A glossary of Russian theatrical terms. Its ambition was greater than the reality. According to the handwritten title-page, it was intended to list words relating to: theatre organisation; front of house; stage management; acting; production; and authorship and criticism. There was also an intention to list: foreign plays whose titles were adapted in Russian; and, authorities titled and numbered for reference. In the event only a few words under 'theatre organisation' were listed and the glossary amounts to only 5 pages with a short listing on the final page."

Biographical / Historical
'This A glossary of Russian theatrical terms was discovered among other material at the Research Annexe, Edinburgh University Library, in 2012, and was placed into the care of Special Collections, Edinburgh University Library. Its author and origin is unkown.'
