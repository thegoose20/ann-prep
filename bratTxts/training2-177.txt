Biographical / Historical
'Henry Dunlop was born in Linwood, Renfrewshire, on 7 June 1799. After education at Glasgow High School and Glasgow University, he entered the family cotton trading business of James Dunlop and Sons. Better known for his political activities, Dunlop entered the town council in 1833 and in 1837 he contested a bitterly disputed election for the post of provost. He only succeeded to the post in 1838 after a judgement in the House of Lords. In 1841 and in furtherance of interested parties in the Church, he contested the parliamentary seat of Bute as a Liberal, but the election ended in defeat for him. This interest in ecclesiastical matters led to his move from the Church of Scotland to the Free Church after the Disruption of 1843. Dunlop was chairman of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce in 1841, 1850 and 1862, and in 1848 was appointed Deputy-Lieutenant of Lanarkshire. Henry Dunlop died in Edinburgh on 10 May 1867.'
