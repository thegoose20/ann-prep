Biographical / Historical
"Edward Taylor, an Architect and Planning Consultant, Tourism and Leisure Projects, in Edinburgh. The McEwan Hall is situated in Bristo Square, adjacent to Edinburgh University's Medical School. It was built by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson (1834-1921) between 1888 and 1897 in Italian Renaissance style, and originally planned as part of the University's new Medical School. It was funded by William McEwan, the brewer, and is used as a graduation, concert, meeting and examination hall. From the early-1990s there had been a study into the refurbishment of the Hall and into the extension of its functions."
