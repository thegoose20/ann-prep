Biographical / Historical
"Since the regime of Siad Barre was ousted in January 1991, turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy have followed in Somalia. Numerous warlords and factions are still fighting for control of the capital Mogadishu and some regions of the south. A refugee group, Scottish Somali Action has been based at Edinburgh University Settlement, Wilkie House, 37 Guthrie St, Edinburgh. Members of the group have in the past been vocal in seeking EU support for Somalia. In February 1997, the group received funding from the City of Edinburgh Council's Economic Development Committee/Urban Regeneration Subcommittee to support workshops. In 2000 the group supported the campaign to defend the Nigerian Eniola Adewale from deportation from Scotland."
