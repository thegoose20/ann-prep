Biographical / Historical
"The James Tait Black Memorial Prize was established by the will of Janet Coats (1844-1918), daughter of Thomas Coats, the Glasgow cotton manufacturer, in memory of her late husband, James Tait Black, whom she had married in 1884. James Tait Black (1826-1911) was son of Adam Black the Edinburgh publisher. Two prizes were to be awarded a year, one for fiction and one for biography. Robert Welsh (1874-1960), Janet Coats/Black's solicitor in Ayr, was the formal administrator; the sole judge was to be the Professor of English Literature at Edinburgh University. Sir Herbert John Clifford Grierson (1866-1960) was Professor of English Literature at the University of Edinburgh between 1915 and 1935."
