Scope and Contents
"The collection is composed of an imposing photograph of John A. W. Dollar, circa 1904-1905, in his presidential robes - President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons - and a bill with engraved bill-head of the Dollar veterinary practice on New Bond Street, London, with a fine engraved bill-head, a rare survival. The portrait was taken by the firm Elliott and Fry, 55 Baker Street, London W, and is numbered in pencil as No.206440D. The bill with engraved bill-head is dated in ink, 1901. It is the account between January 1901 and December 1901 with J. E. Taylor esq., Kensington Palace Gardens, London, and includes interesting information about veterinary costs in the early months of the 20th century - e.g. a 'nailing' presumably for a horse-shoe costing one shilling (January 16), four shoes for six shillings (April 1), and attendance, advice and a bottle of lotion for eight shillings and sixpence (June 13)."
