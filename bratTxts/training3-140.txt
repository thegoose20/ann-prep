Scope and Contents
"Content Description Ms letter from Thomas Carlyle, 5 Cheyne Row, Chelsea, to Peter Millar Cunningham, Surgeon Royal Navy, 4 December 1843.The letter reads: I have received your little Essay on Compass Variations, and read it over with great satisfaction. It is a most ingenious little speculation, or rather big speculation in little bulk; and had it even otherwise, it would have pleasantly brought you to our new embrace, and been very welcome in this hour. You never come to us now; it is lean since we have seen a glimpse of you, - and alas much water has run since those old evenings! I know not where you are, except that it is somewhere within reach of London, and yet not in it. You must come and see us some day; come, some day or evening, and show face again! We have for the present lost even your sister's address, and know not where to find her. With thanks and most kind regards Yours ever truly T. Carlyle An envelope, not necesarily contemporary, accompanies the letter, with pencil notes."
